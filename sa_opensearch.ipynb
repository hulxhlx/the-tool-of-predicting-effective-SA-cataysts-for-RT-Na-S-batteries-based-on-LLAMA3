Herein, a promising nitrogen-deficient catalyst (FeCN) with single atom Fe and Fe2O3 nanoparticles dispersing on g-C3N4 matrix was synthesized and applied as a competent peroxydisulfate (PDS) activator for tetracycline (TC) degradation under visible light. The K-edge X-ray absorption fine structures and 57Fe Mössbauer measurements confirmed the unique configuration of Fe2O3 and single atom Fe active sites (pyrrolic and pyridinic FeN4) induced by the neighbouring nitrogen vacancies. The theory calculations and experiments provided a deep insight into the PDS activation and TC degradation via radical and non-radical pathways. The pyrrolic FeN4 active sites dominated the electron transfer, while the pyridinic FeN4 and Fe2O3 decomposed PDS to produce free radicals. The synergistic effect between the Fenton-like oxidation and photocatalysis is responsible for efficient TC degradation.

However, the intrinsic activity of the Pt1/CeO2 single atom catalysts may not be desirable due to the overstabilization of Pt2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. Herein, the local environment of Pt2+ species was tailored by introducing a tungsten oxide additive into the Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, achieving a dramatic improvement in catalytic performance for CO oxidation at low temperatures. The optimized catalyst with 2.5 wt% W loading achieved 100 % CO conversion at 150 °C, which was 120 °C lower than that of the unmodified Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Through in situ infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction characterizations, as well as theoretical calculations, we concluded that the tungsten additive modulated the interactions between Pt2+ species and CeO2. Thus, the reducibility of Pt was enhanced, which facilitated the formation of catalytically active metallic Pt0 species during the reaction.',\n",

The nano-confined spaces in the CoFe-DSAC@GO membrane facilitate the generation and utilization of ROSs and catalytic activity. Furthermore, theoretical calculations elucidate that the electron transfer among bimetallic Co–Fe single-atom sites promotes peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation.

This study explores new pathways for utilizing Cl- to promote the formation of Fe(Ⅳ)=O by single atom Fe-CNs catalysts under peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system, which significantly increases sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation rate constant by 2.97 times, enhances PMS utilization efficiency (reducing by 92 % PMS consumption) and simultaneously avoids the formation of chlorinated organic byproducts. Experiments and theoretical calculation revealed that the in-situ generated HClO (generated via the reaction of PMS and Cl-) more easily reacts with Fe–pyridinic N active sites of Fe-CNs catalysts to generate Fe(Ⅳ)=O through a lower-energy-barrier pathway, rather than directly oxidates pollutants.

The single-atom Ru species were stabilized on the strained TiO2 surface by strong metal-support interactions. The Ru-S-TiO2 is highly efficient, initiating CER at only 5 mV above the ECER, and has shown excellent stability for over 100 hours. It exhibited >95 % CER selectivity even in acidic media with low Cl− concentrations (0.2 M). Our results demonstrate that the strong metal-support interactions between the atomically dispersed Ru species and the strained TiO2 surface are crucial for the high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of Ru-S-TiO2 for CER.

The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) powered by renewable energy offers a promising solution, however, developing highly active and selective catalysts remains challenging. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown impressive performance, but the crucial role of their coordination environment, especially the next-nearest neighbor dopant atoms, in modulating catalytic activity for NO3RR is underexplored. This study aims to optimize the NO3RR performance of tungsten (W) single atoms anchored on graphene by precisely engineering their coordination environment through first and next-nearest neighbor dopants. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 43 different nitrogen and boron doping configurations were systematically studied using density functional theory. The results reveal W@C3, with W coordinated to three carbon atoms, exhibits outstanding NO3RR activity with a low limiting potential of −0.36 V. Intriguingly, introducing next-nearest neighbor B and N dopants further enhances the performance, with W@C3-BN achieving a lower limiting potential of −0.26 V. This exceptional activity originates from optimal nitrate adsorption strengths facilitated by orbital hybridization and charge modulation effects induced by the dopants. Furthermore, high energy barriers for NO2 and NO formation on W@C3 and W@C3-BN ensure their selectivity towards NO3RR products. These findings provide crucial atomic-level insights into rational design strategies for high-performance single-atom NO3RR catalysts via coordination environment engineering.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single-atom catalysts show good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in metal-air battery. However, the symmetric electron distribution results in discontented adsorption energy of ORR intermediates and a lower ORR activity. Herein, Fe-Co dual-atom catalyst with FeN3-CoN3 configuration was prepared by encapsulating nitrogen-rich ion (triethylenediamine cobalt complex, [Co(en)3]3+) in Fe based MOF cage to greatly enhance ORR performance. Due to the confinement effect of the MOF cage, the encapsulated [Co(en)3]3+ is closer to Fe of MOF, thus easily generating FeN3-CoN3 sites. The FeN3-CoN3 sites can break the symmetric electron distribution of single-atom sites, optimizing adsorption energy of oxygen intermediate. Thus, FeCo-NC exhibits extraordinary ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.915 V and 0.789 V in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively, while it was 0.874 V and 0.79 V for Pt/C. The liquid and solid Zn-air batteries with FeCo-NC as cathode show higher peak power density and specific capacity. DFT results indicate that FeN3-CoN3 site can reduce the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step resulting in an excellent ORR performance.',\n",

The mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4), prepared by the one-step pyrolysis method, possesses a lightweight material with a high surface area (95 m2 g−1) and an average pore diameter (3.6 nm). A simple microwave-assisted preparation method was employed to decorate Cu single-atom over mpg-C3N4 support.

These characterization studies confirmed that the Cu@mpg-C3N4 catalyst exhibited high surface area, mesoporous nature, medium band gap, and low metal loading. The as-synthesized and well-characterized Cu@mpg-C3N4 single-atom photocatalyst is then evaluated for its efficacy in converting N-heterocycles into corresponding N-heteroaromatic compounds with excellent conversion and selectivity (>99 %).

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) to advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) has attracted considerable attention. However, the catalytic pathways and mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. In this study, NiFe-LDH was synthesized and single Ru atoms were stably loaded onto it by forming Ru–O–M (M=Ni or Fe) bonds (Ru@NiFe-LDH). This was demonstrated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (XANES). The Ru@NiFe-LDH/PMS system showed a high catalytic reactivity (100 % sulfamethoxazole degradation in only 30 min), high stability (97 % reactivity was maintained after continuous operation for 400 min), and wide pH suitability (working pH range 3–11) for AOPs. The crucial roles of the high-valent species (Ru(V) = O) and 1O2 in this reaction were verified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that electron transfer produced a positively charged Ru. This enhances the adsorption of negatively charged PMS anions onto the Ru monoatomic sites, thereby, causing the formation of Ru-PMS* complexes. This study implies that the structure–function relationship between organic compounds and SACs plays a significant role in PMS-based AOPs, and provides a comprehensive mechanism for the role of high-valent species in heterogeneous Fenton-like systems.',\n",

Very recently, some experimental works showed that structurally well-defined ultra-small transition-metal clusters (such as Fe and Co tetramers, denoted as Fe4 and Co4, respectively), can efficiently modulate the catalytic behavior of SACs by axial coordination. Herein, taking the graphene-supported MN4 SACs as representatives, we theoretically explored the feasibility of realizing multifunctional SACs for ORR, OER and HER by this novel axial coordination engineering. Through extensive first-principles calculations, from 23 candidates, IrN4 decorated with Fe4 (IrN4/Fe4) is identified as the promising trifunctional catalyst with the theoretical overpotential of 0.43, 0.51 and 0.30 V for OER, ORR and HER, respectively. RhN4/Fe4 and CoN4/Fe4 are recognized as potential OER and ORR bifunctional catalysts. In addition, NiN4/Fe4 exhibits the best ORR activity with an overpotential of 0.30 V, far superior to the pristine NiN4 SAC (0.88 V). Electronic structure analyses reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR/OER activity can be ascribed to the orbital and charge redistribution of Ni/Ir active center, resulting from its electronic interaction with Fe4 cluster. This work could stimulate and guide the rational design of graphene-based multifunctional SACs realized by axial coordination of small TM clusters, and provide insights into the modulation mechanism.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Atomically dispersed iron–nitrogen-carbon (Fe–N4–C) catalysts show great promises for the electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3−) reduction to ammonia (NH3). Nevertheless, the microenvironmental engineering of the single Fe active sites for further optimizing the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Herein, we proposed to regulate the coordination environment of single Fe active sites to boost its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for NO3− –to–NH3 conversion by the incorporation of new heteroatoms, including B, C, O, Si, P, and S. Our results revealed that most of the candidates possess low formation energies, showing great potential for experimental synthesis. Moreover, incorporating heteroatoms effectively modulates the charge redistribution and the d–band center of single Fe active sites, enabling the regulation of the binding strength of nitrogenous intermediates. As a result, the N and C coordinated Fe active site (Fe–N3C) exhibits superior catalytic performance for NO3− electroreduction with a relatively low limiting potential (–0.13 V) due to its optimal adsorption strength with nitrogenous intermediates induced by its moderate charge and d–band center. Importantly, our experimental measures confirmed such theoretical prediction: a maximum NH3 yield rate of 21.07 mg h−1 mgcat.−1 and 95.74 % Faradaic efficiency were achieved for NO3− electroreduction on Fe–N3C catalyst. These findings not only suggest a highly efficient catalyst for nitrate reduction but also provide insight into how to design and prepare electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.',\n",

At present, single atom catalytic nitrogen reduction has become the earliest promising method for industrial production due to its high atomic utilization rate, high selectivity, high controllability, and high stability. However, how to quickly screen catalysts with high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in single-atom catalysts (SACs) remains a challenge. Herein, the 29 SACs are constructed from C6N2 nanosheets doped with transition metals (TM@C6N2), which are analyzed for stability, adsorption performance, NRR catalytic activity, electronic properties, and competitiveness using first-principles calculations. The results show that Mo@C6N2 and Re@C6N2 exhibit the most outstanding catalytic performances, with limiting potentials (UL) of −0.29 and −0.31 V, respectively, in the solvent model. Machine learning is used to derive descriptors from the intrinsic features to predict the free energy changes for the potential-determining step. The importance of features is calculated, with the first ionisation energy (IE1) being the most significant influencing factor. Based on the guidance of machine learning and considering that IE1 is related to the ability of metal atoms to donate electrons, a four-step screening strategy using the Integrated Crystal Orbital Hamilton Populations (ICOHP) to screen catalysts instead of the traditional five-step screening not only improves the screening efficiency but also obtains completely consistent screening results.

Various strategies have been developed to synthesize SACs, among which thermally stable metal centers are usually in high oxidation while they are susceptible to facile sintering in reduced state or under reducing conditions.

In this work, the crucial importance of ligand to the stability of single Pt0 atoms is investigated. While HCl and diether have been found to be able to stabilize single Pt0 atoms by forming Pt1@HCl adducts, HBr coordinated Pt single atom (Pt1@HBr) obtained by simply exchanging HCl with HBr shows increased thermal stability over the Pt1@HCl under H2 atmosphere at elevated temperature, as evidenced by DRFITs of CO chemisorption and HRTEM.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, inefficient hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) remains a key bottleneck in achieving practical fuel cell performance. To address this challenge, precise material design and synthesis are necessary to modulate the electronic structure and maximize the utilization of active sites. Herein, we present a Ru-Co3O4 catalyst, which is synthesized based on a cation exchange strategy through which Ru single atoms are embedded on the surface of Co3O4. Theoretical calculations confirm that Ru single atoms show a stronger hybridization with hydrazine molecules near the Fermi level and significantly lower the energy barrier required for N-containing intermediate formation, contributing to a record-low onset potential of −0.15 V vs. RHE and a working potential of −0.115 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'To realize efficient antibiotics degradation in low-temperature water, single-atom FeN4 sites are engineered near carbon vacancies in a porous catalyst (PCvFe1-5) via thermal-etching and pyrolysis. The high-specific-surface-area (2202.80 m2 g−1) carbon support and dispersive Fe atoms co-enrich sulfamethoxazole and peroxymonosulfate to enhance the reactant collision frequency. Carbon vacancies allow the catalyst to deform for storing the peroxymonosulfate adsorption energies at FeN4 sites, which are subsequently released to facilitate -SO4H desorption for rapid site regeneration. This breaks the scaling relation suffered by single-atom sites, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier. Consequently, a low-temperature-resistant Fenton-like system with ultralow activation energy of 9.06 kJ mol−1 is constructed for sulfamethoxazole degradation. The normalized kinetic rate constant at 2 ℃ exceeds that of reported catalysts working at 25/30 ℃ by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, due to the special site configuration, PCvFe1-5 degrades sulfamethoxazole via both long-range catalyst-mediated electron transfer and short-range direct collision oxidation.',\n",

However, the contradiction between the isolated dispersion feature of metal sites and the high mass-specific activity of the catalyst inhibits the advances of the SACs. Herein, the Pt atoms are confined at the metallic Co phase edge in two-dimensional Co/Co(OH)2 hierarchy structure (PtSA-Co@Co-Co(OH)2) by the defect inducted order electrodeposition strategy. Both integrations of in-situ/ex-situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that such metal edge confined Pt atoms possess an enlarged atom exposure ratio, high stability, and the like-metal electronic state contributed by metal Co 3d, which enables the Pt atoms with more suitable affinity to simultaneously bind the multiple H atoms for durable H*-H2 conversion and H2 evolution. Moreover, the metallic PtSA-Co collaborated Co/Co(OH)2 interfaces demonstrate a strong H2O dissociation capacity by the preference adsorption of H* on metallic PtSA-Co and OH*on Co/Co(OH)2 interfaces. Combining a further enhancement of constructing the catalysts on an Ag nanowire network to form a seamlessly conductive nanostructure, the PtSA-Co@Co-Co(OH)2 achieves a high mass activity with 5.92 A mg−1 at the overpotential of 100 mV in alkaline condition, 37 times to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst and significantly outperforming the reported catalysts. While our work has focused on the hydrogen evolution reaction, this class of metal edge collaborated single-atom catalysts may be conducive to unlock the low mass-specific activity of atomically dispersed catalysts for various processes, such as oxygen evolution reactions (OER), CO2 reduction, and biomass conversion, etc.',\n",

The product catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 196 and 246 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decent overpotentials of 79 and 246 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively.

The enhanced electrocatalytic activities are attributed to surface hydroxylation and doping of synergistic Mo and W SAs. The two defect engineering modifications, as supported by analyses of density functional theory calculations and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, lead to a proper reduction in metal-oxygen covalency, thus minimizing the energy difference of the rate-determining step of the OER process, and create surface active sites with a d-band center located closer to the Fermi level, thus properly strengthening proton binding to enhance HER activities.',\n",

Thanks to its exceptional efficiency and other benefits, peroxymonosulfate offers extensive potential for water treatment. However, realizing the practical application of this technology hinges on creating a high-efficiency catalyst. This study presents the fabrication of a monoatomic Ru catalyst through a straightforward hydrothermal approach. Synchrotron radiation and spherical electron microscopy were used to confirm the binding of monoatomic Ru to the NiFe-LDH (Layered Double Hydroxide, LDH) surface. Using a catalyst containing 0.77 wt% of single-atom Ru, 20 mg/L of Carbamazepine (CBZ) could be eliminated within 25 mins. With this, an impressive pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant of 0.118 min−1 was attained. The feasibility of the catalyst was evaluated in a column experimental reactor. The removal rate of 0.5 g of catalyst in wastewater containing 20 mg/L CBZ reached 100 %, demonstrating sustained operation for 720 mins. Ru-LDH/PMS system preferentially degrades carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and other pollutants.

In this study, a novel N/P-doped Ni/Pt bimetallic catalyst is developed (NiPt@C-NP, 3.68 % Ni, 0.2 % Pt) using polyacrylonitrile fibers as an inexpensive carbon source for catalyst support. Due to strong anchoring from the N and P heteroatoms, the nickel and platinum species are mono-atomically dispersed throughout the catalyst. Under acidic conditions, NiPt@C-NP exhibits a hydrogen evolution overpotential of 89 mV (10 mA cm−2), whereas an unsupported platinum catalyst gives an overpotential of 302 mV. The mass activity of Pt in NiPt@C-NP reaches 36.17 A mgPt−1, which is 33 times higher than 20 % Pt/C (1.07 A mgPt−1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that synergistic interactions between Ni and Pt significantly increase the density of state near the Fermi level of NiPt@C-NP, resulting in a reduced bandgap and an enhanced charge transfer capability. Furthermore, the Gibbs free energy at the Pt and Ni sites is − 0.25 and − 0.63 eV, respectively, indicating fast reaction kinetics.',\n",

The main challenge is the lack of knowledge of the structure, composition, and evolution of species on the nanoparticle surfaces during reaction. We apply a modulation excitation approach to the X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the 30 atomic % Pd in Au supported nanocatalysts via the gas (H2 and O2) concentration modulation. For interpreting restructuring kinetics, we correlate the phase-sensitive detection with the time-domain analysis aided by a denoising algorithm. Here we show that the surface and near-surface species such as Pd oxides and atomically dispersed Pd restructured periodically, featuring different time delays. We propose a model that Pd oxide formation is preceded by the build-up of Pd regions caused by oxygen-driven segregation of Pd atoms towards the surface. During the H2 pulse, rapid reduction and dissolution of Pd follows an induction period which we attribute to H2 dissociation. Periodic perturbations of nanocatalysts by gases can, therefore, enable variations in the stoichiometry of the surface and near-surface oxides and dynamically tune the degree of oxidation/reduction of metals at/near the catalyst surface.',\n",

Experimental and theoretical results collectively reveal that the bridged Ga sites trigger strong metal-support interaction for the homogeneous distribution of Ru clusters with high density, as well as optimize the Ru–H bond strength due to the electron transfer between Ru and Ga for enhanced intrinsic HER activity. Moreover, the oxophilic Ga sites near the Ru clusters tend to adsorb the hydroxyl species and accelerate the water dissociation for sufficient proton supplement in an alkaline medium.

The improvement of catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the enhancement catalysis of weak current (ECWC) rather than electric field, which significantly reduce the energy consumption of the catalytic system by more than 90%. The further mechanism research for the ECWC based on a series of weak current-assisted characterization means and DFT calculations confirms that migrated electrons mainly concentrate around the V single atoms and increase the proportion of antibonding orbitals, which make the V-O chemical bond weaker (electron scissors effect) and thus accelerate oxygen circulation.

This research demonstrates the use of a defective alumina (Al2O3-x) as catalyst support to anchor Pd atoms and suppress the growth of Pd clusters in catalytic methane oxidation. A combination of operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the evolution of Pd species and reveals distinct catalytic methane oxidation mechanisms on Pd single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles (NPs). Among these Pd species, the cluster active centers are found to be the most favorable participants in methane oxidation due to their high dispersion, high content of Pd2+ oxidation state, and resistance to deactivation by carbonates, bicarbonates, and water. The Pd/Al2O3-x catalyst shows increased stability with respect to a Pd/Al2O3 counterpart during simulated aging in alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions due to stronger interactions with the support. This study demonstrates that defect engineering of non-reducible supports can constrain the evolution of active centers, which holds promising potential for widespread utilization across diverse industrial catalytic processes, including various hydrogenation and oxidation reactions.',\n",

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the CuN3 active moiety confers optimal H2O2 adsorption and dissociation properties, thus contributing to high enzymatic activity of CuN3-SAzyme. The introduction of X-ray can improve the kinetics of the decomposition of H2O2 by CuN3-SAzyme. Moreover, CuN3-SAzyme is very stable after a total radiation dose of 500 Gy, without significant changes in its geometrical structure or coordination environment, and simultaneously still retains comparable peroxidase-like activity relative to natural enzymes. Finally, this developed CuN3-SAzyme with remarkable radioresistance can be used as an external field-improved therapeutics for enhancing radio-enzymatic therapy in vitro and in vivo.

This method not only provides a novel approach for synthesizing highly effective copper based single atom catalysts toward ORR, but also offers an in-depth understanding of the synergisms of adjacent ACs on the Cu single atoms (SAs) for highly effective electrocatalytic ORR and Zn-air Battery.',\n",

Density functional theory calculations showed that the S-induced charge transfer effect regulated the electronic distribution of the central metal more efficiently than P, thereby lowering the energy levels for the generation of [rad]OH and increasing the catalytic effect. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified SACNZs showed effects consistent with this theory in both in vitro antibacterial and in vivo ward management assays.

However, achieving high-loading SACs with metal contents above 10 wt% remains challenging. Here we describe a general negative pressure annealing strategy to fabricate ultrahigh-loading SACs with metal contents up to 27.3–44.8 wt% for 13 different metals on a typical carbon nitride matrix. Furthermore, our approach enables the synthesis of high-entropy single-atom catalysts (HESACs) that exhibit the coexistence of multiple metal single atoms with high metal contents. In-situ aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-STEM) combined with ex-situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) demonstrate that the negative pressure annealing treatment accelerates the removal of anionic ligand in metal precursors and boosts the bonding of metal species with N defective sites, enabling the formation of dense N-coordinated metal sites. Increasing metal loading on a platinum (Pt) SAC to 41.8 wt% significantly enhances the activity of propane oxidation towards liquid products, including acetone, methanol, and acetic acid et al.

However, achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the lack of innate activity in most existing catalysts or insufficient active site density. This study delves into the potential of M2C12 materials (M = Cr, Ir, Mn, Mo, Os, Re, Rh, Ru, W, Fe, Cu, and Ti) with high transition metal coverage as SACs for NRR using first-principles calculations. Among these materials, Os2C12 exhibited superior catalytic activity for NRR, with a low overpotential of 0.39 V and an Os coverage of up to 72.53 wt%. To further boost its catalytic activity, a nonmetal (NM) atom doping (NM = B, N, O, and S) and C vacancy modification were explored in Os2C12. It is found that the introduction of O enables exceptional catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, with an even lower overpotential of 0.07 V. Incorporating the O atom disrupted the charge balance of its coordinating C atoms, effectively increasing the positive charge density of the Os-d-orbit-related electronic structure. This promoted strong d-π* coupling between Os and N2H, enhancing N2H adsorption and facilitating NRR processes. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into NRR catalyst design for sustainable ammonia production and offers a reference for exploring alternative materials in other catalytic reactions.',\n",

Herein, atomically dispersed Ru species are anchored into an acidic stable vinyl-linked 2D covalent organic framework with unique crossed π-conjugation, termed as COF-205-Ru. The crossed π-conjugated structure of COF-205-Ru not only suppresses the dissolution of Ru through strong Ru-N motifs, but also reduces the oxidation state of Ru by multiple π-conjugations, thereby activating the oxygen coordinated to Ru and stabilizing the oxygen vacancies during oxygen evolution process. Experimental results including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ powder X-ray diffraction patterns, and theoretical calculations unveil the activated oxygen with elevated energy level of O 2p band, decreased oxygen vacancy formation energy, promoted electrochemical stability, and significantly reduced energy barrier of potential determining step for acidic water oxidation. Consequently, the obtained COF-205-Ru displays a high mass activity with 2659.3 A g−1, which is 32-fold higher than the commercial RuO2, and retains long-term durability of over 280 h.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel series of Ru-supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) catalysts, with a focus on the impact of ruthenium (Ru) loading on the thermocatalytic performance. Varying Ru concentrations were introduced, including 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 wt%, resulting in different Ru particle sizes on g-C3N4 support. Through a multifaceted characterization approach, it was observed that the catalyst containing 1 wt% Ru loading displayed superior performance, with a high density of active sites, indicated by an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 36.8 % at 450 °C and a CO yield of 25 %. This catalyst also exhibited remarkable CO selectivity of 83 % at 375 °C. Conversely, lower loadings of 0.2 and 0.5 wt % Ru were found to be less effective, yielding minimal CO2 conversion. Loadings above 1 wt% Ru, while achieving high CO2 conversion, demonstrated a preference for CH4 production over CO, indicating lower selectivity for the desired product. This study elucidates the critical role of Ru nanocluster size in the catalytic activity and selectivity, with 1 wt % Ru-supported g-C3N4 emerging as a promising candidate for selective CO generation from CO2 hydrogenation, offering a pathway for the valorization of CO2 as a raw material in the chemical industry.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The introduction of single-atom catalysts (SACs) into Fenton-like oxidation promises ultrafast water pollutant elimination, but the limited access to pollutants and oxidant by surface catalytic sites and the intensive oxidant consumption still severely restrict the decontamination performance. While nanoconfinement of SACs allows drastically enhanced decontamination reaction kinetics, the detailed regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we unveil that, apart from local enrichment of reactants, the catalytic pathway shift is also an important cause for the reactivity enhancement of nanoconfined SACs. The surface electronic structure of cobalt site is altered by confining it within the nanopores of mesostructured silica particles, which triggers a fundamental transition from singlet oxygen to electron transfer pathway for 4-chlorophenol oxidation. The changed pathway and accelerated interfacial mass transfer render the nanoconfined system up to 34.7-fold higher pollutant degradation rate and drastically raised peroxymonosulfate utilization efficiency (from 61.8% to 96.6%) relative to the unconfined control. It also demonstrates superior reactivity for the degradation of other electron-rich phenolic compounds, good environment robustness, and high stability for treating real lake water.

The greener and cleaner way of producing and utilizing hydrogen is through water electrolysis and hydrogen fuel cell where the sluggish reaction kinetics bottlenecks the widescale implementation. Hence, in this study, density functional theory (DFT) is utilized to study the HER, OER and ORR performance of pristine and doped silicene sheets where the dopants (B, C, N, Al and P) are introduced as single atom. The thermodynamical stability for pristine and doped sheets are confirmed with ADMP study and the cohesive energy for all the sheets are found to be around -4.2 eV per atom which validates their stability. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of all the sheets is studied and the N doped silicene exhibits better catalytic property with a lowest overpotential of 70 mV and the C doped silicene shown good HER performance with an overpotential of 180 mV. In case of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the pristine silicene is found to behave better in the ORR performance while the C doped silicene has the lowest overpotential compared with the other sheets. The variation in the catalytic performance is studied with the reactivity parameters which implies that the nucleophilic nature of the material enhances the HER performance. Furthermore, the results suggest that C doped silicene can be utilized as a bifunctional catalyst for the HER and OER performance. This study suggests that the silicene in the pure form as well as with dopant can be a good electrocatalyst for the water splitting and fuel cell application.',\n",

However, most of the reported SA catalysts are fixed through the strong bonding between the dispersed single metallic atoms with nonmetallic atoms of the substrates, which greatly limits the controllable regulation of electrocatalytic activity of SA catalysts. In this work, Pt–Ni bonded Pt SA catalyst with adjustable electronic states was successfully constructed through a controllable electrochemical reduction on the coordination unsaturated amorphous Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays. Based on the X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and first-principles calculations, Pt SA was bonded with Ni sites of amorphous Ni(OH)2, rather than conventional O sites, resulting in negatively charged Ptδ−. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the changed configuration and electronic states greatly enhanced absorbability for activated hydrogen atoms, which were the essential intermediate for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The hydrogen spillover process was revealed from amorphous Ni(OH)2 that effectively cleave the H–O–H bond of H2O and produce H atom to the Pt SA sites, leading to a low overpotential of 48 mV in alkaline electrolyte at −1000 mA cm−2 mg−1Pt, evidently better than commercial Pt/C catalysts.

Multiple characterizations, kinetics investigations, and multiscale simulations reveal that Au SACs display remarkable epoxidation activity at a low propylene coverage, but become poisoned at higher coverages. Interestingly, Au NPs can synergistically cooperate with Au SACs by providing distinct active sites required for H2/O2 and C3H6 activations, as well as hydroperoxyl radical to restore poisoned SACs.

However, regulating such a process remains a great challenge due to the insufficient microscopic understanding of electronic structure-dependent reaction mechanisms. Herein, this work probes the origin of catalytic pollutant polymerization using a series of transition metal (Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe) single-atom catalysts and identifies the d-band center of active site as the key driver for polymerization transfer of pollutants. The high-valent metal-oxo species, produced via peroxymonosulfate activation, are found to trigger the pollutant removal via polymerization transfer. Phenoxyl radicals, identified by the innovative spin-trapping and quenching approaches, act as the key intermediate in the polymerization reactions. More importantly, the oxidation capacity of high-valent metal-oxo species can be facilely tuned by regulating their binding strength for peroxymonosulfate through d-band center modulation. A 100% polymerization transfer ratio is achieved by lowering the d-band center. This work presents a paradigm to dynamically modulate the electronic structure of high-valent metal-oxo species and optimize pollutant removal from wastewater via polymerization.',\n",

Thus, highly active catalysts, placed on activity bolstering materials, and permeable electrodes are crucial for CO2RR.

However, preserving the accessibility and activity of the SACs inside the electrode poses major materials development and electrode design challenges. A conventional layered structure SAC electrode typically consists of a gas diffusion layer (GDL), a microporous layer (MPL) and a SAC catalyst layer (SACCL), fabricated by using a powder bonding process. However, this process usually encounters issues such as delamination and instability of SACs due to the weak binder-catalyst-support interface.

In this work, the Pd–Cu single-atom catalysts (Pd–Cu-N-BC) were first prepared by direct growth of Pd–Cu single-atom on bamboo biochar by regulating the concentration of precursors and doping method, and then enhanced electrocatalytic reduction nitrate performance and N2 generation. The results showed that Pd–Cu-N-BC displayed excellent catalytic activity and reusability in electrocatalytic reduction nitrate with a low potential of 0.47 V vs. RHE (@10 mA cm−2). The maximum nitrate removal efficiency and N2 generation could reach about 100% and 72.32% within 180 min, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Cu atoms could catalyze the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to nitrite, and Pd atoms anchored in the nitrogen-doped biochar (N-BC) lattice could catalyze electrochemical reduction of nitrite to N2 involving the formation of hydrogen radical (H*). The characterization results of XANES showed that electronic synergistic effect between Pd and Cu single atoms significantly promotes the N2 production through hydrogenation while inhibiting the generation of byproducts, leading to significantly enhanced electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to N2. Finally, Pd–Cu-N-BC was designed as a 3D particle electrode for enhanced electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate, exhibiting excellent stability and reusability, which could be considered as a suitable candidate for applications in the remediation of nitrate contamination.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The state-of-the-art alkaline hydrogen evolution catalyst of united ruthenium single atoms and small ruthenium nanoparticles has sparked considerable research interest. However, it remains a serious problem that hydrogen evolution primarily proceeds on the less active ruthenium single atoms instead of the more efficient small ruthenium nanoparticles in the catalyst, hence largely falling short of its full activity potential. Here, we report that by combining highly oxophilic cerium single atoms and fully-exposed ruthenium nanoclusters on a nitrogen functionalized carbon support, the alkaline hydrogen evolution centers are facilely reversed to the more active ruthenium nanoclusters driven by the strong oxophilicity of cerium, which significantly improves the hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst with its mass activity up to −10.1 A mg−1 at −0.05 V. This finding is expected to shed new light on developing more efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution catalyst by rational regulation of the active centers for hydrogen evolution.',\n",

However, controllable regulation of single-atom permutations still faces challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that a polarization electric field regulates single atom permutations and forms periodic one-dimensional Au single-atom arrays on ferroelectric Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets. The Au single-atom arrays greatly lower the Gibbs free energy for CO2 conversion via Au-O=C=O-Au dual-site adsorption compared to that for Au-O=C=O single-site adsorption on Au isolated single atoms. Additionally, the Au single-atom arrays suppress the depolarization of Bi4Ti3O12, so it maintains a stronger driving force for separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Thus, Bi4Ti3O12 with Au single-atom arrays exhibit an efficient CO production rate of 34.15 µmol·g−1·h−1, ∼18 times higher than that of pristine Bi4Ti3O12.

Nevertheless, its adoption is currently hindered by inferior H2O2 selectivity and diminished H2O2 yield induced by consecutive H2O2 reduction or Fenton reactions. Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, we endeavor to overcome this challenge by activating a main-group Pb single-atom catalyst via a local micro-environment engineering strategy employing a sulfur and oxygen super-coordinated structure. The main-group catalyst, synthesized using a carbon dot-assisted pyrolysis technique, displays an industrial current density reaching 400 mA cm−2 and elevated accumulated H2O2 concentrations (1358 mM) with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies. Both experimental results and theoretical simulations elucidate that S and O super-coordination directs a fraction of electrons from the main-group Pb sites to the coordinated oxygen atoms, consequently optimizing the *OOH binding energy and augmenting the 2e− oxygen reduction activity.

In addition, five-step screening criteria and volcano plots enable fast prescreening among numerous candidates. We identify that V@T-C2N and Cr@T-C2N are promising candidates with low overpotentials and high selectivity and stability. In particular, a significant negative correlation between the adsorption strength of nitrate and the Gibbs free energy for the last proton-electron coupling step (*NH2→*NH3) was existed, which is considerably advantaged to track the activity trend and reveal the origin of activity.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single atomic catalysts (SACs), especially the catalysts featured by well-developed M-N4 moieties, show excellent catalytic activity and spark enormous attention. However, the highly symmetric active sites may result in some degenerate electronic states for the d orbitals of the center metal atom, which suffer from the unsatisfactory adsorption-desorption behaviors during reaction. Herein, we develop an asymmetric anchor site by two types of nitrogen (sp-N and pyridinic N) created in the inherent edge-rich carbon domain of hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), where atomic catalyst like manganese atoms can be asymmetrically anchored on the one side of hexagon carbon rings. The abundant elegant hexagon carbon rings on HsGDY not only facilitate the creation of edge sites, but also provide available space for the coordination of terminal ligands (OH) with Mn atoms. The as-synthesized Mn-N-HsGDY exhibits excellent ORR activity and an impressive long-term cyclability for over 3800 cycles in a rechargeable Zn-air battery.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'A novel iron-based single-atom catalyst (Fe SAC) integrated into a catalytic membrane was developed for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and organic pollutant degradation. The Fe SAC membrane was synthesized using a co-precipitation method and acid leaching treatment, and its catalytic activity was evaluated in a continuous flow-through system using nitenpyram (NPR) as a model pollutant. The Fe SAC membrane/PMS system achieved over 90% NPR removal efficiency with low iron leaching (2.85–8.05 μg/L) during 10 hours of continuous operation, and maintained over 80% NPR removal in tap water, Yellow River water, and Yangtze River water. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the strong chemisorption and electron transfer between PMS and FeN4 led to the dominant production of singlet oxygen for NPR degradation. This study demonstrates the potential of SAC-based catalytic membranes for efficient and stable attenuation of refractory organic pollutants in water treatment applications.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Developing well-defined catalysts to ameliorate overpotential and cycling capability is imperative for high-performance Li-O2 batteries. However, conventional catalysts face fundamental challenges that ORR and OER with different rate-determining steps are catalyzed by the same active center, inevitably weakening the selectivity and activity. Herein, we report a cross-scale catalyst with ultrafine RuPt nanoparticles and surrounding RuPt pairs on porous carbon (RuPt NPs@RuPt-N-C). The planted Ru single atoms within Pt nanoparticles and carbon matrix contribute to a fresh bifunctional catalytic mechanism for enhancing ORR/OER catalytic kinetics. As a proof-of-concept application in Li-O2 batteries, this catalyst realizes extremely low overpotentials of only 0.43 V and superior cyclic stability of 209 cycles at 200 mA g−1. Experimental and computational results disclose that for Pt NPs@Pt-N-C without Ru functionalization, only Pt-N-C works as ORR/OER active centers. By contrast, for RuPt NPs@RuPt-N-C, due to downshifted d-band center and enhanced charge transfer with LiO2 intermediate, the Pt nanocrystals are fully activated by Ru atoms, making RuPt nanocrystals as preferable ORR kinetics promoter for the formation of easily-decomposed nanoflower Li2O2. Moreover, adjacent RuPt pairs with weakened O2 affinity can work as major OER center, contributing to accelerating the following Li2O2 decomposition. This work expands the frontier of cross-scale electrocatalysts with tailored bifunctional catalysis properties for other electrocatalytic fields.',\n",

Methods: A composite sulfur host, coupled with a porous current collector, was developed to mitigate the shuttling problem. Iron single atom (SAFe) decorated hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS), composited with cobalt sulfide nanowire arrays supported on free-standing carbon cloth (S-Co@CC), were fabricated as a high-performance sulfur host for LSBs. The sulfur host combines the high electrical conductivity and physical confinement capability of HMCS, the excellent polysulfides chemisorption capability of cobalt sulfide nanowire arrays, and the high catalytic efficiency of iron single atoms toward polysulfide conversion reactions, to achieve a high-performance LSB. Significant findings: The S-Co@CC/SAFe-HMCS based LSB exhibited a high initial specific capacity of 1430 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C. For cycling stability, a specific capacity of 578 mAh g−1 was maintained after a 600-cycle operation at 1 C, achieving an ultralow average capacity decay rate of 0.029 % per cycle.

Yet despite their high catalytic activity through rational modulation, challenges remain in their low site density and unsatisfactory mass transfer structure. Herein, we present a structural engineering approach employing a soft-template coating strategy to fabricate a hollow and hierarchically porous N-doped carbon framework anchored with atomically dispersed Fe sites (FeNC-h) as an efficient ORR catalyst. The combination of hierarchical porosity and high exterior surface area is proven crucial for exposing more active sites, which gives rise to a remarkable ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.902 V in 0.1 M KOH and 0.814 V in 0.1 M HClO4, significantly outperforming its counterpart with solid structure and dominance of micropores (FeNC-s). The mass transfer property is revealed by in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. The distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis is further introduced to deconvolve the kinetic and mass transport processes, which demonstrates an alleviated mass transport resistance for FeNC-h, validating the effectiveness of structural engineering.

For noble metal systems, most cutting-edge research focuses on single atoms, including the exploration of coexistence between single atoms and clusters, yet there are few reports on the impact of noble metal clusters with different coordinations on catalyst performance. Additionally, investigations into metal vacancies, as opposed to oxygen vacancies, are also scarce. In this work, we used CoAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a precursor, which, after calcination and etching, yielded derived oxides with Al vacancies (LDO5). Pt was then loaded onto the surface of these oxides via impregnation (Pt/LDO5). Activity tests demonstrated that Pt/LDO5 exhibited superior HCHO oxidation activity, especially at low temperatures, compared to Pt/LDO. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), we discovered that, in contrast to the “standard” Pt clusters on the LDO surface, Pt primarily existed as low-coordination clusters on the LDO5 surface, even with a higher Pt loading. Moreover, the coexistence of Al vacancies and low-coordination Pt clusters effectively enhanced the spin state of Co species in the support and altered the direction of electron transfer between Pt and the support.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single metal atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon materials (M-N4) have been identified as effective active sites for catalyzing the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). However, the relationship between the local atomic/electronic environments of the M-N4 sites (metal atoms coordinated with different types of N species) and their catalytic activity for 2e-ORR has rarely been elaborated clearly, which imposes significant ambiguity for the rational design of catalysts. Herein, guided by the comprehensive density-functional theory calculations and predictions, a series of Zn-N4 single-atom catalysts (SACs) are designed with pyrrole/pyridine-N (NPo/NPd) synergistic coordination and prepared by controlling the pyrolysis temperature (600, 700, and 800 °C). Among them, the dominated Zn-N4 configurations with rationally combined NPo/NPd coordination show *OOH adsorption strength close to the optimal value, much superior to those with mono N species. Thus, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of over 90% both in neutral and alkaline environments, with a superb H2O2 yield of up to 33.63 mol g−1 h−1 in an alkaline with flow cell. More importantly, a new descriptor, dz2+s band center, has been proposed, which is especially feasible for predicting the activity for metal types with fully occupied s and d orbitals.

Hybrid Ru-modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) catalysts were prepared by thermal polymerisation of melamine/Ru(III) acetylacetonate mixtures, and subsequent thermal exfoliation. Simultaneous Ru incorporation and thermal exfoliation impacted the morphology and the structure of the g-C3N4 sheets, and low-atomicity Ru species with small nanoclusters and single atoms were observed only in the Ru-modified exfoliated g-C3N4 photocatalysts. We demonstrated the potential of a joint thermal exfoliation and modification with Ru to enhance the H2O2 synthesis efficiency of the g-C3N4 photocatalyst under simulated sunlight. A volcano-type behavior was observed with increasing the Ru content, and the best performance was obtained for exfoliated g-C3N4 with an ultra-low Ru content of 0.019 wt.%, that outperformed both its bulk counterpart and the pristine exfoliated reference in terms of initial H2O2 synthesis rate and H2O2 formation rate constant. The enhanced performance was attributed to the presence of highly dispersed low atomicity Ru as well as to more accessible active sites and carrier migration channels.

Here, we propose a methodology for the fabrication of carbon aerogels (CA)-supported SACs utilizing papermaking nanofibers, which incorporates advanced strategies for N-atom self-doping, defect/vacancy introduction, and single-atom interface engineering. Specifically, taking advantages of using green and energy-efficient feedstocks, combining with a direct pore-forming template volatilization and chemical vapor deposition approach, we successfully developed N-doped carbon aerogels immobilized with separated iron sites (Fe-SAC@N/CA-Cd). The obtained Fe-SAC@N/CA-Cd exhibited substantially large specific surface area (SBET = 1173 m2/g) and a multi-level pore structure, which can effectively mitigate the random aggregation of Fe atoms during pyrolysis.

Herein, carbon nitride (CN) decorated by ruthenium (Ru) cocatalysts existed as SA + cluster, cluster + nanoparticles (NPs), and NPs were prepared by impregnation and calcination processes. The correlation between existential form, content of Ru cocatalyst and H2 evolution rate were carefully discussed. It was found that Ru NPs were favor for water molecule adsorption, whereas Ru SAs and clusters facilitated H2 desorption. Theoretical calculations revealed that Ru clusters + NPs cocatalyst were beneficial for H* intermediate formation. Water splitting tests found that 1.07 wt% Ru NPs + cluster modified CN showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 13.64 mmol h−1 g−1, which was 266.4 and 1.5 times higher than those of CN and Ru NPs (2.33 wt%) decorated CN, respectively. This work deeply reveals the influences of existential form of Ru cocatalysts on photocatalytic water splitting of CN, and provides thought in designing new cocatalysts to largely enhance H2 evolution.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Applications of zinc-air batteries are partially limited by the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); Thus, developing effective strategies to address the compatibility issue between performance and stability is crucial, yet it remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose an in situ gas etching-thermal assembly strategy with an in situ-grown graphene-like shell that will favor Mn anchoring. Gas etching allows for the simultaneous creation of mesopore-dominated carbon cores and ultrathin carbon layer shells adorned entirely with highly dispersed Mn-N4 single-atom sites. This approach effectively resolves the compatibility issue between activity and stability in a single step. The unique core–shell structure allows for the full exposure of active sites and effectively prevents the agglomerations and dissolution of Mn-N4 sites in cores. The corresponding half-wave potential for ORR is up to 0.875 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in 0.1 M KOH. The gained catalyst (Mn-N@Gra-L)-assembled zinc-air battery has a high peak power density (242 mW cm−2) and a durability of ∼ 115 h. Furthermore, replacing the zinc anode achieved a stable cyclic discharge platform of ∼ 20 h at varying current densities. Forming more fully exposed and stable existing Mn-N4 sites is a governing factor for improving the electrocatalytic ORR activity, significantly cycling durability, and reversibility of zinc-air batteries.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Formic acid is a high-prospect energy carrier of sustainable H2 and can also favorably supply sustainable H2 to hydrogenation catalysts in replacement of external pressurized H2. A solar photon-assisted synthesis method was successfully implemented for decorating a ceria-modified TiO2 support with ultra-dispersed Ru nanoclusters with a large fraction of low atomicity species and Ru single atoms. Adding ceria to the TiO2 support at a quarter of the theoretical monolayer is a suited surface modification for partially reducing the detrimental intrinsic activity of the bare TiO2 surface for the dehydration of formic acid, what allows the undesired formation of CO to be mitigated and higher selectivities to H2 to be achieved when using the Ru/CeO2/TiO2 catalyst. The dual (combined) photonic/thermal excitation of the Ru/CeO2/TiO2 catalyst boosted the H2 production rate and allowed the dehydrogenation reaction to be conducted at a lower temperature compared to the dark conditions, for instance with a 80°C downshift at 190°C, what corresponded to a 42 % relative gain compared to the dark conditions. Advanced electron microscopy characterization has been crucial to unveil the atomic-level nature of the Ru/CeO2/TiO2 photo-thermo catalyst, bringing to light the presence of ultra-dispersed metallic Ru nanoclusters, both (i) decorating nanometric-sized flat CeO2 nanoparticles interfaced in epitaxy with high-index TiO2 facets, and (ii) being homogeneously distributed over the TiO2 surface in close vicinity with low atomicity CeO2 species.',\n",

The mechanism analysis indicates the filling of d-orbital electrons of TM-atom can play an important role in determining the value of an energy descriptor (ΔGOH*), and the suitable ΔGOH* values make for the TM@g-C7N3 candidates to possess favorable OER/ORR overpotential. Particularly, the Rh-d orbital of Rh@g-C7N3 is evidently hybridized with the OH*-p orbital, resulting in the lone electrons initially distributed in the antibonding orbital pairing up and occupying the downward bonding orbital, ensuring OH* can be adsorbed on Rh@g-C7N3 appropriately.

Utilizing high energy β Particle bombardment on the surface of photocatalysts induces the generation of edge S vacancies in SCNC, while promoting the formation of heterometallic single-atom clusters (Con, Nin) in NCS. The edge sulfur vacancies on the surface of SCNC exhibit high reactivity and adsorption capacity. The aggregation of Co and Ni at this position can transfer photo generated electrons to the edge sulfur vacancies, thereby protecting the edge sulfur vacancies and prolonging the carrier lifetime. Electrons enriched in edge S vacancies can activate the O–O bond of PMS, thereby achieving efficient degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP). The degradation kinetics constant of Con-Nin/NCS/SCNC-Sv/PMS is 1.69 times higher than that of NCS/SCNC/PMS.

However, the mechanism of the atomically dispersed dual metal atom with the coordination of various heteroatoms used as the sulfur cathode catalyst and trapper remains unknown. This study introduces, for the first time, atomically dispersed Co and Mn in-situ immobilized on O, N dual-doped hollow carbon spheres (SACoMn/C-(N, O)) as sulfur host. Experiments combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergy between Co-(N, O) and Mn-(N, O) sites enhances the nucleation/deposition and decomposition capabilities of Li2S. This enhancement is attributed to the anchoring-coupling-conversion behavior of sulfur species on the SACoMn/C-(N, O) surface, which effectively restrains the shuttle effect and facilitates the conversion kinetics. Moreover, the cooperation of dual metal atoms with O, N non-metal atoms embedded in the carbon network structure accelerates electric transport and ion diffusion kinetics.

So far, considerable efforts have been paid to understanding the microstructural evolution of Pd − Pt catalysts during high-temperature ageing, while much less is known about the key features in these catalysts at industry-related mild temperatures (e.g., ≤ 550 °C). In this article, by starting from platinum and palladium nitrates impregnated on commercially available γ-Al2O3, the microstructural evolution of Pd − Pt/Al2O3 induced by calcinations at below 550 °C in air was distinguished and further disentangled by comparison with the cases of Pt/Al2O3. Supported by electron microscopy, in situ DRIFTS, and other characterizations, we showed that the PdO nanoparticles on Pd − Pt/Al2O3 catalysts worked not only as a reactive phase for alkane combustion, but also as a “trapper” that reduced the amount of single-site Pt1 species by anchoring and aggregating them on the PdO (101) surface during calcinations. Since these Pt single atoms were highly reactive for the combustion of alkenes, Pd − Pt/Al2O3 exhibited enhanced methane/ethane/propane oxidation activity with increasing Pd contents, but were weaker ethylene and propylene oxidizers than Pt/Al2O3. Water and sulfur tolerance tests were also performed to evaluate the true practicability of the catalysts, which demonstrated the overall higher robustness of the Pd-free recipes for light hydrocarbon combustion.',\n",

Herein, using first principles study, we systematically investigate the prospect of nonmetal (B, C, O and F) doped monolayers g-GaN as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction. We found that nonmetal doping can effectively regulate the electron distribution and p-band center of the active center (N site), which can adjust the initial adsorption, activation degree, charge transfer amount of CO2, and promote the formation of intermediates. Interestingly, B and C doped systems have better catalytic activity for CH4, with limiting potentials of −0.61 and −0.53 V, respectively. More importantly, F doped system has higher activity and selectivity for CH3OH production and inhibit competitive HER, with lower limiting potentials of −0.60 V.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The problems of poor Faraday efficiency and high overpotential usually limit electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR) catalysts. In this paper, 28 different transition metal single-atoms (TM-SAs) supported on W2N3 (TM@W2N3) were designed by density functional theory (DFT) for catalytic N2 reduction. The stability, N2 activation capacity, selectivity and NRR mechanism of TM@W2N3 were analyzed. Following the screening process, only 9 TM@W2N3 (TM=Sc, Ti, V, Co, Cu, Y, Mo, Ag, W) structures were identified as exhibiting high stability, strong activation capacity and high NRR selectivity. And then N2 activation mechanism of V@W2N3, Mo@W2N3 and W@W2N3, as well as the Gibbs free energies of its four NRR reaction pathways were further discussed. The overpotentials (η) of Mo@W2N3 and V@W2N3 to NRR are 0.129 V and 0.470 V, respectively. The overpotential (η) of W@W2N3 is the lowest at 0.059 V, while its catalytic activity is the highest. V@W2N3 and W@W2N3 are more likely to follow the distal pathway for NRR, while Mo@W2N3 is more likely to follow the enzymatic pathway.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts with low overpotential and industrial-level current density is crucial to CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER). However, the poor modulating of intermediate *CO effective coverage results in low selectivity of target product. Herein, a feasible strategy to modulate *CO effective coverage on isolated nickel sites through S-coordinated doping (Ni-NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S species in the coordination of Ni-NSC leads to a low-coordination state of center Ni atom, which enhances hybridization of the d band with the 2π* orbital of CO, improving CO coverage. As a result, Ni-NSC reaches an industrial-level current density of over 280 mA cm−2 in a membrane electrode assembly device, and realizes the maximum FECO above 95 %. Control experiments and characterizations reveal that the monovalent Ni atomic center in the Ni-NSC after S doping promotes the formation of reactive intermediate *COLFB and improves *CO effective coverage, thus boosting the CO2ER kinetics.',\n",

The comprehensive characterization results demonstrated that the participation of water molecules in the catalytic oxidation reaction of benzene could be effectively promoted by enhancing the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) at the core-shell interface, which would change the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. As a result, the Pt1/CeO2@SiO2-4 catalyst with a Pt-O-Si active interface exhibits good activity (T = 190 °C) as well as excellent water resistance under the wet condition (10 vol%).

Paradoxically, this would degrade the activity due to the constricted accessibility of active sites to reactants. Herein, carbon nanotubes with abundant mesoporous defects and Fe-N4 species were elaborately designed to be multifunctional protective armor to encapsulate Ni3Fe nano-alloys (Ni3Fe@CNTs/Fe-N4) for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. In/ex-situ spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the constructed mesoporous carbon defects effectively facilitate the multiphase mass transfer and the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics via strong electrons coupling with packaged Ni3Fe nano-alloys. Meanwhile, the synchronously introduced Fe-N4 moieties could serve as oxygen reduction active sites. Thus, the obtained Ni3Fe@CNTs/Fe-N4 hybrid electrocatalyst simultaneously exhibits remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity (E1/2=0.86/Ej=10=1.59 V vs RHE) and durability over 450 h in the chronoamperometric test at 1.59 V, endowing the assembled Zn-air batteries (ZABs) with a high power density (150 mW cm−2) and lifespan (307 h), much better than that employing benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 mixed catalyst.

In particular, the construction of bimetallic catalytic sites can address the limitations of single-metallic catalysts, such as clustering and slow electron transfer, which enhances electron transfer between active sites and promotes photocatalytic activity. In this paper, Mn and Co bimetallic catalyst (Mn/Co@N-biochar) was developed by using the electronegativity difference of the bimetallic sites on N-doped biochar to construct catalytically active sites to enhance electron transfer. XRD and HR-TEM characterization confirmed that metal atoms were evenly dispersed within the carbon layer without aggregation or clustering of metal particles. The catalytic efficiency of Mn/Co@N-biochar was assessed through sulfanilamide (SNM) degradation experiments, demonstrating a remarkable degradation rate of 99.3% and a mineralization rate of 49.0%. These values were 10.45 times and 13.24 times more than that for biochar, respectively, indicating that the loading of bimetals greatly improved the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the doping of N atoms adjusted the electronic structure of adjacent C atoms and activated the free-flowing π electrons on the biochar surface, creating solid anchoring sites that facilitated efficient electron circulation between Mn and Co atomic sites. The higher local electron density at the Co-N4 site compared to the Mn-N4, created electron transfer channels, where Mn atoms (catalytic site) facilitated the flow of electrons to Co atoms (active site). This could rapidly generate the primary active species (‧OH and ‧O2-) to degrade SNM. Additionally, the stability and applicability of bimetallic catalysts in real water systems were also confirmed, providing valuable insights for the construction of bimetallic biochar structures to degrade organic pollutants in water.',\n",

The Ni1@mp-CeO2 catalyst has a higher CH4 conversion, and less deactivation rate, as compared to the Ni1/CeO2.

Importantly, Pt ADCs, including Pt-O1Ni1 single atoms and Pt sub-nanoclusters (Pt1+n/Ni3S2), show good basic HER activity, which just need 17 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency for Pt1+n/Ni3S2 is 0.49 H2 s−1 under the overpotential of 100 mV, which is 8.6 times higher than Pt/C. Besides, the assembled RuO2 || Pt1+n/Ni3S2 system could get 100 mA cm−2 current density under 1.7 V cell voltage in alkaline water electrolyzer.

In this study, a series of Fe-N-C single-atom enzymes (SAzymes) and Fe-Co magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized via pyrolysis. Fe-N-C SAzymes with high peroxidase-mimetic activity were successfully utilized as TMB chromogenic catalysts for detecting AFB1 via the CRISPR/Cas12a colorimetric aptamer sensor. In the absence of the AFB1 target, its aptamer bound to crRNA and activated the trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, indiscriminately cutting single-stranded DNA and releasing significant amounts of Fe-N-C SAzymes into the supernatant, which catalyzed the change of TMB to blue.

However, their sluggish reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effects remain major challenges. Current research on SACs focuses on adjusting their coordination structure to bolster the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides while overlooking their enhancement through modulation of the electronic structure of the metal centers. This study proposes a novel approach for synthesizing nitrogen-doped Co-SACs (Co-SAC@NC). Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that nitrogen doping leads to a high Fermi energy level within Co-SAC@NC, signifying an elevated average energy of the electrons. This elevation results in significant splitting and lifting of degeneracy among d-orbitals in Co metal, which ultimately leads to a high-spin configuration. This configuration enhances the orbital interactions between the polysulfides and the catalyst, causing a decrease in the energy barrier and fast conversion from polysulfides to lithium sulfide. Thus, it improves the polysulfide kinetics. As a result, the batteries with the Co-SAC@NC modified separator exhibit a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 1465 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and excellent rate performance (736 mAh g−1 at 4C), outperforming most Co-SAC-based Li-S batteries.',\n",

While these SACs must be dispersed on solid substrates, the underlying support is usually limited to carbon materials that have a poor ability to modulate the coordination environment and electronic structures of single atoms, and consequently their catalytic activity toward the SRR is restricted. Here we propose two-dimensional (2D) graphene/electride heterostructures as substrates to enhance the catalytic activities of SACs for Li-S batteries. 2D electrides featuring the anionic electron gas on their surface enable efficient electron transfer to SACs, which alters their electronic structures, resulting in the shifts of the d orbital and Fermi levels. This unique electronic structure decreases the filling of antibonding states such that the bonding with adsorbates at active sites is enhanced. We demonstrate the enhanced catalytic performance of SACs in terms of the Gibbs free energy of SRR and Li2S dissociation.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Developing highly efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to promoting carbon neutrality. However, challenges such as low activity, selectivity and high costs hinder industrial scaling, attributed to the lack of innate activity or insufficient transition metal (TM) active site density in current catalysts. Therefore, the focus of CO2RR research remains on developing SACs with intrinsic catalytic activity, high TM coverage and cost-effectiveness. This study presents the design of carbon-based materials with ultra-high TM coverage (TM2C12) (TM = Mo, Ru, Rh, W, Re, Os and Ir) as electrocatalyst SACs for CO2RR using density functional theory calculations. Among these materials, W2C12 (W represents tungsten) demonstrates superior selectivity and catalytic activity for CO2RR to carbon monoxide (CO) products with overpotentials of 0.45 V and a W coverage of up to 71.84 wt%. To further enhance its catalytic activity, non-metallic (NM) coordination modification (NM = B, N, O, P doping and C vacancy) was explored on W2C12. The results indicate that N-doped W2C12 (N-W2C12) can significantly improve selectivity and catalytic activity, achieving an extremely low overpotential of 0.34 V.

Among the many products of CO2RR (carbon monoxide, acids, aldehydes and alcohols, olefins, etc.), alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc.) have a higher market value and energy density, but it is also more difficult to produce. Copper is known to be effective in catalyzing CO2 to high value-added alcohols, but with poor selectivity. The progress of Cu-based catalysts for the selective generation of alcohols, including copper oxides, bimetals, single atoms and composites is reviewed. Meanwhile, to improve Cu-based catalyst activity and modulate product selectivity, the modulation strategies are straighten out, including morphological regulation, crystalline surface, oxidation state, as well as elemental doping and defect engineering. Based on the research progress of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for alcohol production on Cu-based materials, the reaction pathways and the key intermediates of the electrocatalytic CO2RR to methanol, ethanol and propanol are summarized. Finally, the problems of traditional electrocatalytic CO2RR are introduced, and the future applications of machine learning and theoretical calculations are prospected.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'This work intends to simulate the interaction of metal single-atom(s) supported on surfaces of H-magadiite (H4Si14O30) and Al substituted H-[Al]-magadiites (H5AlSi13O30), hereafter called M/H-magadiite and M/H-[Al]-magadiite (M = Ag, Au, Pt, Pd), using DFT calculations (PBE and PBE-D3 functionals). Three distinct positions were defined in all surfaces to optimize each simulated model: “hydroxyl”, “edge” and “cavity”. The Au/H-magadiite and Ag/H-magadiite models were more stable at the “hydroxyl” sites. Meanwhile, in the aluminated surfaces, the presence of an extra hydrogen atom (here called Hextra, located in the “edge” region) was responsible for a more stable situation of these metal atoms. On the other hand, the Pd and Pt single-atoms present in H-magadiite and H-[Al]-magadiites showed greater interaction with all the sites, compared to the Au- and Ag- models. Based on the binding energies and other electronic calculations, the aluminol site at H-[Al]-magadiites has the best capacity to support metal species. For example, the Pt/H-[Al]-magadiite showed the lowest binding energy (-2.64 eV for PBE and -2.93 eV for PBE-D3), the strongest charge interaction and the smallest Pt – Hextra distance (1.55 Å). The migration barriers (PBE) in Ag/H-magadiite, Au/H-magadiite, and Pd/H-magadiite were lower than 21.50 kJ·mol−1, suggesting the high possibility of metal sintering. For all the cases, the PBE-D3 overestimated the barriers. Contrarily, the Pt/H-magadiite structures stabilized in the “cavity” region, inside the silicon rings of the silicate, and presented a migration barrier greater than 200 kJ·mol−1. These calculations offered the first indications of the behavior of single-atoms, which will serve as the basis for a broader description, in future works, of the migration of metal species in the Al-models simulated here, as well as for modeling single-atom catalysts that can be used in stable conditions.',\n",

This novel DL-FeNC catalyst is synthesized through a double-layer (DL) MOF strategy. Compared with the conventional SL-FeNC which is synthesized by single-layer (SL) MOF, the high loading of single iron atoms (3.33 wt%) in DL-FeNC led to a significant enhancement of the intrinsic activity.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia has garnered significant attention with the blooming of single-atom catalysts (SACs), showcasing their potential for sustainable and energy-efficient ammonia production. However, cost-effectively designing and screening efficient electrocatalysts remains a challenge. In this study, we have successfully established interpretable machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the catalytic activity of SACs by directly and accurately predicting reaction Gibbs free energy. Our models were trained using non-density functional theory (DFT) calculated features from a dataset comprising 90 graphene-supported SACs. Our results underscore the superior prediction accuracy of the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model for both ΔG(N2→NNH) and ΔG(NH2→NH3), boasting coefficient of determination (R2) score of 0.972 and 0.984, along with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.051 and 0.085 eV, respectively. Moreover, feature importance analysis elucidates that the high accuracy of GBR model stems from its adept capture of characteristics pertinent to the active center and coordination environment, unveilling the significance of elementary descriptors, with the colvalent radius playing a dominant role. Additionally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis provides global and local interpretation of the working mechanism of the GBR model. Our analysis identifies that a pyrrole-type coordination (flag = 0), d-orbitals with a moderate occupation (Nd = 5), and a moderate difference in covalent radius (rTM-ave near 140 pm) are conducive to achieving high activity. Furthermore, we extend the prediction of activity to more catalysts without additional DFT calculations, validating the reliability of our feature engineering, model training, and design strategy. These findings not only highlight new opportunity for accelerating catalyst design using non-DFT calculated features, but also shed light on the working mechanism of “black box” ML model. Moreover, the model provides valuable guidance for catalytic material design in multiple proton-electron coupling reactions, particularly in driving sustainable CO2, O2, and N2 conversion.',\n",

Herein, we demonstrate that the descriptor Ω parameterized by readily accessible intrinsic properties of metal center and coordination is highly operational and efficient in rational design of single-atom catalyst (SAC) for driving electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR). Using two-dimensional metal (M)-BxPySzNm@C2N as prototype SAC models, we reveal that *N2 + (H+ + e−) → *N2H acts predominantly as the potential-limiting step (PLS) of NRR on M-B2P2S2@C2N and M-B1P1S1N3@C2N regardless of the distinction in coordination microenvironment. Among the 28 screened M active sites, with Ω values close to the optimal 4, M-B2P2S2@C2N (M = V (Ω = 3.53), Mo (Ω = 5.12), and W (Ω = 3.92)) and M-B1P1S1N3@C2N (M = V (Ω = 3.00), Mo (Ω = 4.34), and W (Ω = 3.32)) yield the lowered limiting potential (UL) as −0.45, −0.54, −0.36, −0.58, −0.25, and −0.24 V, respectively, thus making them the promising NRR catalysts. More importantly, these SACs are located around the top of volcano-shape plot of UL versus Ω, re-validating Ω as an effective descriptor for accurately predicting the high-activity NRR SACs even with complex coordination. Our study unravels the relationship between active-site structure and NRR performance via the descriptor Ω, which can be applied to other important sustainable electrocatalytic reactions involving activation of small molecules via σ-donation and π*-backdonation mechanism.',\n",

Compared to single-atom catalysts, diatomic catalysts not only retain advantages such as high active sites, unsaturated coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, but also incorporate multiple interactive mechanisms. This integration enables them to surpass the limits of single-atom catalysts in catalytic performance, demonstrating a unique ability of “1 + 1 > 2”. Consequently, diatomic catalysts turn out to be a hot topic in the field of catalytic reactions driven by coupling processes. Currently, catalysts that are loaded on material surfaces with two different single-atom-level metal coordination environments are commonly referred to as diatomic catalysts. Reviews reported to date mainly categorize and study the differences and advantages of homonuclear and heteronuclear bimetallic active centers in diatomic catalysts. However, this conceptual distinction has obscured the impact of spatial configuration differences on catalytic mechanisms. For diatomic catalysts, the differences in coordination environments between the two atoms lead to changes in spatial configuration, which in turn produce specific synergistic effects, greatly influencing the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic reactions. With this in mind, this paper, for the first time, clarifies the definition of diatomic catalysts based on different spatial configurations, resolving long-standing confusion. Catalysts with two types of atoms dispersed in isolation without any connection are defined as dual-single-atom catalysts; those with two atoms connected either through a heteroatom bridge or direct bonding are defined as dual-atom catalysts. Additionally, this paper summarizes the latest research progress in the synthesis methods and technical characterization of these two types of catalysts. Furthermore, it explores the mechanisms of dual-core synergy and primary-secondary synergy in dual-single-atom catalysts, as well as the electron effects caused by distance effects and unique functional environments in dual-atom catalysts that contribute to enhancing the catalytic performance of dual-atom catalysts. These are key to achieving the “1 + 1 > 2” catalytic performance in various catalytic fields for both dual-single-atom catalysts and dual-atom catalysts. Further, in the field of electrocatalysis, this paper reviews the structure–activity relationships of diatomic catalysts for various reactions and focuses on how in situ characterization techniques and first-principles calculations can reveal these relationships in depth. Finally, it explores the challenges faced by dual-atom catalysts and dual-single-atom catalysts in practical applications, offering new perspectives for the rational design and thorough research of efficient dual-atom catalysts and dual-single-atom catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explore the stability of a single platinum atom on various flat, stepped, and defective ceria surfaces, in the context of single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. The adsorption properties and diffusion kinetics of the metal strongly depend on the support termination with large stability on metastable and stepped CeO2(100) and (210) surfaces where the diffusion of the platinum atom is hindered. At the opposite, the more stable CeO2(111) and (110) terminations weakly bind the platinum atom and can promote the growth of metallic clusters thanks to fast diffusion kinetics. The adsorption of carbon monoxide on the single platinum atom supported on the various ceria terminations is also sensitive to the surface structure. Carbon monoxide weakly binds to the single platinum atom supported on reduced CeO2(111) and (211) terminations. The desorption of the CO2 formed during the WGS reaction is thus facilitated on the latter terminations. A vibrational analysis underlines the significant changes in the calculated scaled anharmonic CO stretching frequency on these catalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'There is a flurry of interest in enhancing the stability and efficiency of photoelectrocatalysts in water splitting at high current densities. In the present study, nickel–iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) was decorated with MIP-177-LT (Ti-metal organic framework (MOF)) to fabricate a heteroatom electrocatalyst (NiFe-LDH@Ti-MOF). The overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) turned out to be very low: 199 and 232 mV at current densities of 200 and 600 mA cm−2, in that order. Then, current densities of 1,000 mA cm−2 were applied to the modified electrode over a long period of 800 h, and this generated a higher stability than that of the commercial IrO2. Further, its mass activity proved ∼2 and 7 times as high as those of IrO2 and NiFe-LDH, in that order. Furthermore, for water splitting, the produced photoelectrocatalyst obtained a current density of 1,000 mA cm−2 using only 1.6 V, and this performance remained changeless for 800 h, which can be considered the most superb performance ever reported. The experimental characterization revealed that during the process of doping Ti-MOF on NiFe-LDH, symmetry breaking takes place in the atomic structure of the LDH surface, which increases the active sites in the photoelectrocatalyst. The presence of oxygen in the Ti-MOF active sites improves the efficiency of OER at high current densities and also contributes to the higher stability of multiple heteroatomic interfaces for water splitting. The propounded strategy enables the generation of oxygen and hydrogen from water splitting at high current densities on an industrial scale by changing the symmetry of the atomic structure of heteroatomic photocatalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Lithium‑sulfur (Li[sbnd]S) batteries are distinguished by their high theoretical capacity and relatively low theoretical cost. Overcoming the well-known shuttle effect is of paramount importance for the development of high-performance Li[sbnd]S batteries. While various advanced cathode materials have significantly enhanced the reaction kinetics, the intricate mechanism of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) continues to present a challenge for the improvement of Li[sbnd]S battery performance. Consequently, an extensive investigation into the electrocatalytic mechanism is undoubtedly one of the key aspects to direct the development and real-world use of cathode materials. In this paper, a single atom catalyst synthesized (SACs) with P1N3 coordinated transition metal (TM) elements is used as the cathode catalytic material, and an electrocatalytic model is established. The detrimental effects of the shuttle effect in Li[sbnd]S batteries are mitigated, while the kinetic mechanism of the cathode reaction is enhanced, thereby improving the overall performance. The chemical mechanism of the rate-determining step in the SRR has been elucidated using a TM@P1N3 SACs. It is found that Sc@P1N3 with a lower overpotential and lower ICOHP value can accelerate the SRR. Effective descriptors such as overpotential and energy barrier can be employed as measures of the SACs. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for the design of superior electrocatalysts for Li[sbnd]S batteries.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a new frontier in catalysis, merging the positive aspects of both homogeneous and heterogenous catalysts. CO2 electrochemical reduction is a key reaction for the energy transition. In this work, we investigate the role of the local coordination on the activation of CO2 on SACs, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We scrutinize 20 transitional metal atoms embedded in a graphene support. The results indicate that the local coordination has a critical role both to the binding energy of the metal to the support and the activation of CO2. The role of the environment around the active site is as important as the nature of the metal atom. At the same time, the stability of reaction intermediates strongly depends on the local coordination. In some cases, the relative stability of the intermediates changes as function of the environment, affecting the selectivity of the reaction. This study provides evidence of the importance of the local coordination in single-atom catalysis, a crucial aspect if one is interested in providing a rationale to the reactivity, or in predicting novel catalysts.',\n",

Rare earth catalysts have a wide range of applications in alkaline solution oxidation, but limitations in their stability and activity prevent their further application. In this paper, Au doped CeO2 coated porous Aux/CeO2 (x = 1,2,3) was designed as a three-function electrocatalyst with excellent performance and stability. At 1 M KOH conditions, both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reactions exhibit excess potentials of 159.6 and 320.8 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. In addition, when incorporated into an Au2/CeO2 (0.05 mmol, HAuCl4·4H2O) microparticles, the catalyst exhibits the potential of 1.42 V(10 mA cm-2) containing 0.33 M urea in 1 M KOH. Remarkably, for hydrogen production driven by urea electrolysis, Au2/CeO2 demonstrated exceptional performance by requiring only a voltage input of 1.63 V. The reducing agent that forms the Au/CeO2 heterojunction modulates the electronic structure of the Au active site and optimizes the adsorption of the intermediate. In addition, the interaction of the Au monolayer with the CeO2 nanosphere effectively prevents excessive oxidation and dissolution of Au, and the porous hollow structure provides additional exposed active sites and facilitates mass transfer.',\n",

Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the structure-activity relationship between the composition of terminal atoms and the catalytic activity of Pt-doped VCl-Ti2CO2-xClx single-atom catalysts (SACs). Firstly, the results demonstrate clear linear correlations between the composition and the work function, interlayer average transfer charges (Δq), and the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) of the Pt-O bond that adsorbs OH. Besides, the difference in the average transferred charge between the Ti and the C layers (Δq5–3) and the ICOHP of Pt-O bond adsorbing OH can be used as effective descriptors of bifunctional performance of Pt-doped VCl-Ti2CO2-xClx. Furthermore, the bonding and charge transfer between the active site Pt and adsorbed intermediate OH are elucidated, revealing the bridging role of dxz and dz2 orbitals of Pt during the activation process. Based on the above understanding, we reported a catalyst of Pt-VCl-Ti2CO0.22Cl1.78 with a low bifunctional overpotential (ηBi = 1.00 V), effectively reducing the overpotential of Pt-doped Ti2CO2.

This work found that low-load single-atom copper (0.1 wt%) anchored on g-C3N4 (SA-Cu/g-C3N4) exhibited excellent ability to activate H2O2 and inactivate ARBs during the photo-Fenton process. The presence of SA-Cu/g-C3N4 (0.4 mg/mL) and H2O2 (0.1 mM) effectively inactivated ARBs. More than 99.9999 % (6-log) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) could be inactivated within 5 min. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing pathogenic Escherichia coli (ESBL-E) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) were killed within 10 and 30 min, respectively. In addition, more than 5-log of these ARBs were killed within 60 min in real wastewater. Furthermore, D2O-labeling with Raman spectroscopy revealed that SA-Cu/g-C3N4 completely suppressed the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state and reactivation of bacteria. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy results demonstrated that g-C3N4 mainly produced 1O2, while SA-Cu/g-C3N4 simultaneously produced both 1O2 and •OH. The •OH and 1O2 cause lipid peroxidation damage to the cell membrane, resulting in the death of the bacteria. These findings highlight that the SA-Cu/g-C3N4 catalyst is a promising photo-Fenton catalyst for the inactivation of ARBs in wastewater.',\n",

Herein, the work contributes to the efficient and selective vanillin (VAN) CTHDO process using formic acid (FA) as the H-donor over a novel lignin-coordinated N-anchoring Ni single-atom catalyst (Ni SAs-N@LC). Ni SAs-N@LC was fabricated through facile pyrolysis of lignin-Ni/Zn complex mixed with melamine, in which lignin localized the Ni atoms through its negatively charged groups (e.g. phenolic OH) and the dispersed Ni atoms were further anchored by the N-doped carbon support to form Ni-N3 active structure. DFT calculations revealed that the Ni-N3 structure preferentially adsorbed the –CHO end of VAN and endowed the catalyst with superior hydrogen evolution capacity. Therefore, Ni SAs-N@LC exhibited outstanding catalytic performance (98.93% of VAN conversion and 97.3% of 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol selectivity) which was significantly higher than two reference catalysts Ni NPs@LC (without N-anchoring) and Ni@C (without lignin coordination and N-anchoring) as well as the previously reported Ni-based catalysts. Moreover, Ni SAs-N@LC presented excellent feasibility to the CTHDO of a wide range of lignin-derived aldehydes and exhibited superior cycling durability in FA system owing to its acid resistance property.

The anchoring of W single atom narrowed the energy-band, negatively shifted the conduction band of g-C3N4, and promoted the charge transfer and photogenerated carrier separation. Moreover, W single-atom intercalation obviously favored the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2), as validated by the active species capture test and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which played an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of PPCPs.

Compared to bulk g-C3N4, the cry-CNN had higher ECL intensity due to increasing the crystallinity to change the charge transport of electrons in the layer. Besides, benefiting from the unique electronic structure and catalytic activity of Co SA, the obtained Co SA@cry-CNN represented enhanced ECL intensity at a lower negative potential than that of cry-CNN, owing to the Co SA not only accelerated the electron transfer of the cry-CCN in heptazine cavity, but also promoted the co-reactive S2O82- to produce more active intermediate SO4•–. Interestingly, the experimental results showed that the ECL emission of Co SA@cry-CNN was about 23 times higher than that of BCN, and was 5 times higher than that of cry-CNN.

This study aimed to demonstrate that the formation of atomically dispersed Rh on ceria and the corresponding Rh electron density can be tuned depending on ceria concentration. The highly optimized Rh/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity during propylene hydroformylation, which was similar to that of the commercially available homogeneous catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3. Combined analytical results and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the increased Ce3+ fraction promoted high Rh electron density and attenuated CO adsorption strength, resulting in an increased hydroformylation activity. Additionally, the catalyst achieved separation and high added value by converting olefins to aldehydes through hydroformylation of olefins in a mixed C2–C4 olefin/paraffin gas. This study showed that atomically dispersed metal supported catalysts can be designed as recyclable heterogeneous catalysts by tailoring the local environment and corresponding electron density of the metal to achieve high activity similar to that of the homogeneous catalysts that manipulate ligands around the metal.',\n",

In this work, the catalytic performance of 1T-VS2 (1T phase of vanadium disulfide) nanoribbons in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated based on first-principles calculations. It was found that 1T-VS2 nanoribbons have a Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of 0.05 eV, demonstrating its excellent HER performance. Moreover, some transition metal substitutions can further improve this performance (e.g. the ΔGH* of the Ti/Fe-1T-VS2 are as low as −0.02/0.04 eV). The mechanism of the performance enhancement is thoroughly investigated. The improved catalytic performance of HER is mainly promoted by hybridization between the V-d and TM-d-orbitals. The crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) and integral crystal orbital Hamiltonian habitation (ICOHP) calculations show that the HER properties are closely related to the filling of bonding and antibonding states. The differential charge density indicates that the adsorption of H results in an effective charge transfer at the interface and an increase in the conductivity, leading to an increase in the HER. The HER activity of the TM-1T-VS2 (TM stands for transition metal) nanoribbons is also related to the proximity of the adsorption site to the edge.

All the considered 2D substrates have various inequivalent anchoring sites like top, hollow, bridge, and vacancy sites for Ni-atoms. So, there are total 34 anchoring sites, and we computed binding energy (Eb) of Ni-atom over all the sites. Having large number of configurations, we first applied a screener on stability of Ni@2D and only considered those configurations for which the Eb value is <-3.00 eV for further calculations. Out of 34, 17 configurations were falling in this range. Further, we computed the differential Gibbs free energy of H-adsorption (ΔGH) and generated volcano plot between ΔGH and exchange current density (i0) as a prime indicators of HER activity. Then, we screened these configurations based on ΔGH values that |ΔGH|≤ to 0.5 eV, and out of 17, 10 systems were falling in this region. At last, we examined complete reaction profile of HER via Volmer-Heyrovsky (VH) and Volmer-Tafel (VT) mechanisms over the remaining 10 configurations, and the lowest activation energy for HER are 0.12 eV and 0.21 eV for Ni@AlN and 0.28 eV and 0.36 eV for Ni@h-BN via VT and VH mechanism, respectively. Our findings show Ni@AlN and Ni@h-BN could be a non-noble TM candidate for eco-operational HER catalyst. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.)',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The emerging transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) are expected to have high activity for converting detrimental formaldehyde (HCHO) under mild conditions. Currently, the exploitation of novel SACs with designed or modified support surfaces remains largely imperative. Herein, we used density functional theory to explore the catalytic performance for HCHO oxidation on various single-atom Pt-loaded ZrO2 surfaces, in which oxygen vacancy and lattice hydroxyl group were included on the surfaces. The surface modifications could enhance the co-adsorption of HCHO and O2 molecules and provide more active sites due to interfacial electron redistribution. The transition state search approach was applied to investigate the oxidation pathways on various ZrO2-supported SAC surfaces, wherein distinct dehydrogenation mechanisms and intermediates were clarified. The oxygen vacancy defects and hydroxyl groups can enhance the catalytic activity for HCHO oxidation by providing active receptor sites for the H-transfer and facilitating the C[sbnd]H bond breakage. Microkinetic modeling was further used to characterize the reaction rates and kinetics behavior of HCHO oxidation on the SAC surfaces. Our simulation demonstrates the excellent catalytic performance of the modified ZrO2-supported SAC in the HCHO oxidation. Meanwhile, the mechanism is also an important implication for the synthesis and design of novel SACs.',\n",

In-situ combining MOF and rGO in a composite structure by adjusting their weight proportion is a key to preparing an active 3D-on-2D structured catalyst with FeN4 active sites.

Currently, the major challenge of MDA reaction lies in the rapid catalyst deactivation via coke formation, hindering large-scale industrialization of the process. Herein we report an enhanced conversion route of MDA in the presence of methanol on Mo-based zeolite materials. Compared to regular ZSM-5, ZSM-11, and their mechanically mixed counterparts, Mo embedded in ZSM-5/ZSM-11 intergrown matrix exhibits higher methane conversion (16.0%) and aromatics selectivity (62.5%) while limiting coke production to 12.1% under the co-feeding of methane and methanol (nCH4/nCH3OH = 30). If no methanol addition, coke selectivity is up to 45.1% in MDA reaction. Additionally, hydrogen enriched syngas (nH2/nCO = 6) was obtained as a co-product of the methane and methanol co-aromatization. NH3-adsorbed 1H MAS NMR, Co2+ titrated UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that a proper amount of Brönsted acid sites and the binuclear Mo anchored on the Al pairs at the intersection cavity may account for the superior reaction performance of the intergrown zeolites. A catalytic mechanism was also proposed via 13CH3OH isotopic labeling tracer and in-situ 13C solid-state NMR studies. Methanol is first decomposed into CO/H2, while CO is hydrogenated to CH4 and converted into CO2 via the water-gas shift reaction. Alternatively, methanol is converted into CO/CO2 through formate intermediates. Subsequently, CO2 reduces coke deposition via the reverse Boudart reaction, which improves the catalytic performance.',\n",

In this study, we systematically investigate the electrocatalytic NRR performance of 43 types of single-atom catalysts (SACs) constructed by introducing single transition metal (TM) or/and nonmetal (NM) atoms in graphyne (TM-NM-GY) through first-principles calculations. It is found that Mn-, Os-, B-, Ti-B-, V-B-, Cr-B-, Ru-B-, and Os-B-GY exhibit remarkable efficiency for NRR, showcasing overpotentials lower than 0.34 V. Particularly, Os-B-GY stands out by demonstrating ultra-high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for NRR as well as good experimental feasibility, with an impressively low overpotential of merely 0.13 V. The co-doping of Os and B allows for adjusting moderately positive charge densities around Os, which enables strong d-2π* coupling between Os and N2. As a result, the N≡N triple bond is remarkably weakened, facilitating the subsequent NRR process. Moreover, benefiting from the cooperative doping of NM and TM, the potential limiting step is changed, which breaks the inherent linear volcanic relationship between the free energy of the critical intermediate N2H* and limiting potential (UL) on the sole TM-doped system, further enhancing the activity and selectivity. We anticipate that the insights gained from this comprehensive and systematic study can offer valuable guidance for the design and synthesis of novel and highly efficient SACs toward NRR.',\n",

Thus, maintaining high reactivity and stability while achieving high ethylene selectivity faces a challenge. The coordination environment of the first metal atom is reasonably adjusted by coordinating with the second adjacent metal atom, which provides the possibility of stimulating the intrinsic reactivity of SACs and maintaining the atomic properties unchanged during the reaction. Here, we prepared Pd1-Cun/Al2O3 catalysts with palladium single-atom species (Pd1) and copper cluster species (Cun) loaded on Al2O3 support by combining “anchoring” and “site isolation”, which effectively prevented the Pd1 transition to Pd cluster species (Pdn) during the reaction process while improving the activity of Pd1. The reaction evaluation results revealed that the activity of the Pd1-Cun/Al2O3 catalyst increased by 60 % compared with the Pd1/Al2O3 catalyst, and the stabilization time of ethylene selectivity (83 %) of Pd1-Cun/Al2O3 catalyst increased by > 100 h when the same conversion for both catalysts. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (AC-HAADF-STEM), Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the “synergistic effect” of Cun and Pd1 is the main reason for the increase of reactivity, and the “site isolation” effect of Cun is a key factor in preventing the transition of Pd1 to Pdn.

Indeed, understanding the complex competitive mechanisms of oxygen and chlorine formation at the anode is an analytic challenge. An argument for direct seawater electrolysis is presented with a dissection of the complications that arise at the anode in the presence of seawater ionic constituents such as the chloride ion. Electrolyser system durability and the impact on the current and voltage efficiencies are discussed. Critical challenges at the anode under the acidic conditions of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis interrelate the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to elucidate the heterogenous mechanisms of the OER and the CER and the crucial stability predicament under selective OER electrocatalysis. The selectivity circumstances resolved by Density Functional Theory computations shed insight onto the reaction conditions that select for the preferred OER adsorbate chemisorption on the surface and substantiates the observed overpotentials required for the OER and CER; experimental rotating ring disk electrode analysis further indicate competitive adsorption of OER and CER reactants under an assumed Langmuir isotherm model. Identifying the rate determining step and breaking the scaling relationship of the AEM OER pathway may both improve the stability of the catalyst and achieve lower OER overpotentials. Critical insight is given into designing the heterogeneous electrocatalyst structure with selective facets, additional point defects, and augmented active site density through single atom catalysts. An argument for the utilization of ruthenium for its high natural ubiquity and modulable valence states that can facilitate atomic configurations with optimal active site d-band center energies to promote selective adsorbate binding is presented. Studies of in-situ filtration of the chloride ion under acidic conditions highlight the utility of manganese oxide and silica; the augmentation of the conductivity through manipulation of polaronic interactions; and the design of heterogeneous electrocatalysts with self-healing characteristics demonstrated in select molecular catalysts that may decrease the overpotential of the OER and achieve selectivity.

In particular, the engineered H-Co SACs with dense active Co-N4 moieties in the edge sites were found to display 3.1 times higher catalytic activity than that of traditional intact Co single-atom catalysts (L-Co SACs). Combined experimental and theoretical simulations reveal that the geometric structure and the interactions between adjacent edge-hosted CoN4 sites synergistically affect the electronic structure of the Co single-atom nanozymes, resulting in strong oxygen adsorption/activation and low energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) in the reaction process, which are demonstrated be more beneficial for the oxidase-like catalytic performance.

Herein the copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper perfluorocyanine (CuF16Pc) molecular catalysts, which share the same −(Cuδ+-N4)- moiety with SCMs but are commercially available, are attempted for ENRR. The CuF16Pc, which differs from CuPc by the substitution of the H in Pc with F, shows alleviated intermolecular agglomeration and increased electron-deficiency of. the Cuδ+ center, owing to the electron-withdrawing effect of F. The alleviated intermolecular agglomeration exposes more Cuδ+, which makes CuF16Pc outperform CuPc (2254.9 vs. 1979.3 mg-NH3 h−1 gCu−1) and most of the reported catalysts in the mass activity of ENRR. However, the Cuδ+ with a larger electron-deficiency in CuF16Pc is less active than that in CuPc for ENRR, owing to the higher energy barrier for NO* hydrogenation to NOH* on it. It reminds us that the CuPc is more ideal for ENRR if its agglomeration issue can be addressed. Finally, an integrated continuous-flow system composed of the CuF16Pc-driven ENRR and PVDF fibers-mediated NH3 separation is customized, which enables a steady NO3−-N removal efficiency of 96.4 % and NH3-N recovery efficiency of 97.2 % from simulated nitrate-contaminated water.',\n",

Herein, we construct a series of rare earth (RE) single atoms on MnO2 nanosheets with modulated oxygen states by an effective and universal Ar plasma (P)-assisted strategy (P-RE SAs@MnO2, RE = Gd, La, Ce, Tm, and Lu) to investigate the origin of RE-enhanced OER performance. Taking P-Gd SAs@MnO2 as a representative, the atomically dispersed Gd atoms on MnO2 assist the construction of localized asymmetric [Gd−O−Mn] units, which induces electron accumulation at surrounding oxygen sites by introducing the polarized ionic Gd−O bond. As a result, the P-Gd SAs@MnO2 delivers impressive OER performance with low overpotential (281 mV@10 mA cm −2; ηj10), robust long-term stability, and optimized activation energy (Ea = 32.07 kJ mol−1 at ηj10), which are superior to RE-free MnO2, commercial RuO2, and most Mn-based catalysts. Similar enhanced OER performance can also be found for other P-RE SAs@MnO2 (RE = La, Ce, Tm, and Lu). X-ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy unveil the preferred electron accumulation at Mn−O, promoting the formation of terminal MnIV=O intermediates in OER. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the construction of [Gd−O−Mn] unit endows the surface lattice unsaturated O site with the labile property, which assists the direct formation of (O−O) dimer for circumventing the universal scaling relation applied by the formation of *OOH.

Compared with most reported MOFs-based photocatalysts, the TMPd showed an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (1.32 mmol g−1 h−1) and the NO removal efficiency (62%) under visible light irradiation. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS) proved that pd in TMPd existed in an isolated state, and the atomic force microscope (AFM) proved the ultrathin morphology of TMPd. DFT calculations had demonstrated that single-atom Pd could serve as the active center and more effectively achieve electron transfer, indicating that single-atom Pd played a vital role in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

The results showed that these SACs can be firmly stabilized on these defective BC3 supports with high stability against aggregation. Furthermore, co-activation of the inert N2 reactant was observed in certain embedded SACs and their neighboring B atoms on certain BC3 sheets due to the noticeable charge transfer and significant N–N bond elongation. Our high-throughput screening revealed that the Mo/DVCC and W/DVCC exhibit superior NRR catalytic performance, characterized by a low limiting potential of −0.33 and −0.43 V, respectively, which can be further increased under acid conditions based on the constant potential method. Moreover, varying NRR catalytic activities can be attributed to the differences in the valence state of active sites. Remarkably, further microkinetic modeling analysis displayed that the turnover frequency of N2–to–NH3 conversion on Mo/DVCC is as large as 1.20 × 10−3 s−1 site−1 at 700 K and 100 bar, thus guaranteeing its ultra-fast reaction rate.

However, it is time-consuming and tedious to regulate metal-acid-base sites to balance major reactions to render a high 1,2-PG yield. We herein report support size simultaneously regulated ruthenium-sulfoacid-nitrogen (Ru–SO3H–N) sites for cellulose hydrogenolysis to high yield 1,2-PG. Originated from the depolymerization and reassembly of zinc-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (ZnBTC) fiber with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) in water, 2-methylimidazole infiltrated nanorod (ZnBTC(mIM)) with a varied aspect ratio was fabricated by varying the feed ratio of ZIF-8/ZnBTC. Upon being pyrolyzed, sulfonated and impregnated with Ru ions, the supported sites were tailored in terms of Ru single-atom/nanocluster ratio, SO3H acidity and N basicity. The elaborately fabricated catalyst delivers 32.3% yield of 1,2-PG, corresponding to a high productivity of 67.71 mol h−1 gRu−1 and a large turnover number of 34193, two and three orders of magnitude higher than those by using other Ru-containing catalytic systems for cellulose hydrogenolysis. The excellent performance can be attributed to optimized electronic and molecular structure of Ru–SO3H–N sites that can improve rate-determining cellulose hydrolysis/fructose hydrogenolysis, pivotal glucose isomerization with others to proceed at a matched rate. This study opens a new avenue to facilely tailor the metal-acid-base sites by rational design of size controlled supporting matrix.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), featuring attractive electronic/geometric configuration and excellent catalytic performance, have emerged a novel class of heterogenous catalysts. However, the linear limitations of ADMCs for complex catalytic reactions, such as the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for C2+ products, constrain the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Hence, we proposed a tandem ADMCs (T-ADMCs) model for the first time, which is inspired by the tandem catalysis observed in the multienzyme catalytic cycles of biocatalytic systems. The coupled multistep reactions occurring at the adjacent sites in T-ADMCs may promote flow-line ECO2RR and optimize the overall catalytic performance. This perspective overviews the recent research advances on T-ADMCs for ECO2RR and highlights the advancing orientation of T-ADMCs. Reaction mechanisms based on CO, formic acid, and acetaldehyde intermediates on T-ADMCs are proposed. The activity-promoting effects of tandem catalyst are elucidated, including the regulation of electronic structure via long-range interaction, breaking of linear scaling relationship, and modulation of local microenvironment through intralayer or interlayer diffusion. The challenges, opportunities, and further development of T-ADMCs and reaction mechanisms under realistic electrocatalytic environment are proposed. This work sheds new light on the design of high-performance T-ADMCs.',\n",

However, the activity of catalyst with single active site is limited by the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energy of intermediates. Motivated by the idea of multiple activity centers, triple metal clusters (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Rh) doped PC6 monolayer (M3@PC6) were constructed in this study to investigate the CO2RR catalytic performance via density functional theory calculations.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single-atom catalysts (SACs), due to their maximum atomic utilization rate, show tremendous potential for application in the electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia from nitrate. Yet, the development of superior supports that preserve the high selectivity, activity, and stability of SACs remains an imperative challenge. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and tight-binding (TB) model analysis, a new two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitride monolayer, C7N6, is proposed. The C7N6 structure exhibits a strong covalent network, with dynamical, thermal, and mechanical stability. Surprisingly, the structural transition from C9N4 to C7N6 corresponds to a semimetallic state transition. Further symmetry analysis unveils that the Dirac states in C7N6 are protected by space–time inversion symmetry, and the physical origin of the Dirac cone was confirmed using the TB model. Additionally, a non-zero Z2 invariant and significant topological edge states demonstrate its topologically nontrivial nature. Considering the excellent structural and topological properties of C7N6, a three-step screening strategy is designed to identify eligible SACs for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and Ti@C7N6 is identified as possessing the best activity, with the last proton-electron coupling step *NH2→*NH3 being the potential-determining step (PDS), for which the limiting potential is 0.48 V. Moreover, a free energy diagram shows that the *NOH reaction pathway is energetically preferred on Ti@C7N6, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations at 500 K confirm its good thermal stability. Our study not only provides excellent CN-based support material but also offers theoretical guidance for constructing highly active and selective SACs for nitrate reduction.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Simultaneously enhancing the durability and catalytic performance of metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−Nx−C) single–atom catalysts is critical to boost oxygen electrocatalysis for energy conversion and storage, yet it remains a grand challenge. Herein, through the combination of early and late metals, we proposed to enhance the stability and tune the catalytic activity of M−Nx−C SACs in oxygen electrocatalysis by their strong interaction with the M2′C–type MXene substrate. Our density functional theory (DFT) computations revealed that the strong interaction between “early-late” metal–metal bonds significantly improves thermal and electrochemical stability. Due to considerable charge transfer and shift of the d-band center, the electronic properties of these SACs can be extensively modified, thereby optimizing their adsorption strength with oxygenated intermediates and achieving eight promising bifunctional catalysts for ORR/OER with low overpotentials. More importantly, the constant-potential analysis demonstrated the excellent bifunctional activity of SACs supported on MXene substrate across a broad pH range, especially in strongly alkaline media with record-low overpotentials. Further machine learning analysis shows that the d-band center, the charge of the active site, and the work function of the formed heterojunctions are critical to revealing the ORR/OER activity origin. Our results underscore the vast potential of strong interactions between different metal species in enhancing the durability and catalytic performance of SACs.',\n",

In this study, we have synthesized a Ni single atom catalyst with S doping at the second-shell on the ultrathin carbon nanosheets support (Ni-N4-SC) by solid-phase pyrolysis. The S atom in the second-shell contributes to the higher efficiency of CO2 conversion at lower potentials while the Ni-N4-SC can be more stable. The experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the S atom in second-shell breaks the uniform charge distribution and reduces the free energy of hydrogenation, which can increase the adsorption of CO2, accelerate charge transfer, and reduce the reaction energy barrier.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and phonon dispersion spectra reveal the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the GY surface. The exceptional stability of all supported STM1 atoms within the H1 cavity of the GY surface exists in an isolated form, facilitating the uniform distribution and proper arrangement of single atoms on GY. In particular, Sc1, Co1, Fe1, and Au1/GY demonstrate promising catalytic efficiency in the HER due to idealistic ΔGH* values via the Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway. Notably, Sc1 and Au1/GY exhibit superior HER catalytic activity compared to other studied catalysts. Co1/GY catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and activity for the OER, with an overpotential (0.46 V) comparable to MoC2, IrO2, and RuO2. Also, Rh1 and Co1/GY SACs exhibited promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, with an overpotential of 0.36 and 0.46 V, respectively. Therefore, Co1/GY is a versatile electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries and water-splitting. This study further incorporates computational analysis of the kinetic potential energy barriers of Co1 and Rh1 in the OER and ORR. A strong correlation is found between the estimated kinetic activation barriers for the thermodynamic outcomes and all proton-coupled electron transfer steps. We establish a relation for the Gibbs free energy of intermediates to understand the mechanism of SACs supported on STM1/GY and introduce a key descriptor.

Diverse strategies have emerged in recent years to address this challenge. MgH2 has stood out as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its impressive gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density, but its practical application is hampered by elevated thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. In this study, we introduce a solution by synthesizing Pd metallene through a one-pot solvothermal method, revealing a distinctive highly curved lamellar structure with a thickness of around 1.6 nm. Incorporating this Pd metallene into MgH2 results in a composite system wherein the starting dehydrogenation temperature is significantly lowered to 439 K and complete dehydrogenation occurs at 583 K, releasing 6.14 wt.% hydrogen. The activation energy of dehydrogenation for MgH2 was reduced from 170.4 kJ mol–1 to 79.85 kJ mol–1 after Pd metallene decoration. The enthalpy of dehydrogenation of the MgH2–10 wt.% Pd sample was calculated to be 73 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 and decreased by 4.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 from that of dehydrogenation of pure MgH2 (77.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1).

In the upgrading of lignin-derived 4-propylguaiacol, single-atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2−H achieved a conversion of 96.9 % and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3 % under 3 MPa H2 at 250 °C for 3 h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0 %. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2−H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2−H reduced the energy barrier of CAr−OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single-atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2−H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin-derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil-based 4-alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin-derived monomers.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Light-driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into high value-added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C−H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well-defined C−H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond-breaking and -forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value-added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.',\n",

Methane activation has been considered as the rate–controlling step of the DRM process. Here, we performed DFT+U calculations for methane activation on Ni1/CeO2(111). Our results indicated that the Ni atom in Ni1/CeO2(111) transfers electrons to the CeO2(111) surface, the support surface is reduced, the stability of the surface O atom decreases, and the Ni single atom is an oxidation state. The Ni single atom was considered to be active sites, and in addition to the reason for the high activity of Ni itself towards methane, the most stable adsorption site of methane molecules on Ni1/CeO2(111) is also the Ni top site. Four different pathways for the activation of the first C–H bond of methane were examined. The methane molecule adsorbed on Ni1/CeO2(111) has been activated, and that C–H bond, which is usually considered to be the first to be activated, has an energy barrier of 0.80 eV. However, two of the other three C–H bonds have lower energy barriers when used as the first to be activated. We analyzed this anomaly in depth and revealed its cause from the point of view of electronic properties. In addition, we examined the complete dissociation of methane and generation of CO, as well as CO2 activation. Our results showed that the Ni1/CeO2(111) catalyst has excellent CH4 and CO2 activation capability with little carbon accumulation, which is instructive for the design of Ni–based catalysts for commercial DRM.',\n",

However, conventional methods for preparing NDC typically rely on petrochemical compounds, which are not environmentally friendly. Herein, we propose a sustainable and innovative approach by employing protein-rich green algae as a source to prepare NDC for Ru catalysts. To maximize the CO2 reduction effect, flue gas exhausted from industrial processes was utilized as a CO2 feed to cultivate the green algae in a photobioreactor. The harvested green algae were pyrolyzed at 800 °C under an N2 atmosphere to prepare the NDC. After the metalation of Ru on prepared NDC, the Ru catalysts exhibited a turnover number of 7,599 for CO2 hydrogenation which demonstrated the potential of green algae as a raw material for NDC. However, the catalysts were deactivated due to the leaching or agglomeration of weakly bound Ru analyzed by experimental and theoretical investigations. We applied a NaBH4 treatment to stabilize the Ru active sites, and the treated catalysts retained 99.6 % of their initial catalytic activity after five recycling tests. Furthermore, Ru on NDC achieved a cumulative turnover number of 16,000 after 24 h.

However, designing a photocatalyst with high activity, selectivity, and stability for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is challenging because of the slow inert activation of N2 and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a single metal site anchored to a triazine-based covalent organic framework (Tr-COF) backbone (named TM@Tr-COF; TM = Fe, Co and Ni) is fabricated for high-performance catalytic N2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations show that the Fe@Tr-COF, Co@Tr-COF and Ni@Tr-COF can effectively activate N2 and reduce it to NH3 via the electron “acceptance–donation” process. Meanwhile, the NRR occurs via the enzymatic pathway on the Fe@Tr-COF, Co@Tr-COF and Ni@Tr-COF with a limiting potential of 0.38 V, 0.58 V and 0.54 V, respectively. Furthermore, the anchoring of Fe/Co/Ni on the Tr-COF allows the Tr-COF to be adjusted to the appropriate edge position and visible light-absorption region, indicating that the system may be a promising and efficient photocatalyst. Compared with other competitive reactions, the system exhibits high selectivity for NH3 production and inhibits competitive HERs.

Utilizing Fe–N/C SACs as dual signal amplifier, an efficient bipolar electrode (BPE)-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay was presented for determination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The cathode pole of the BPE-ECL platform modified with Fe–N/C SACs is served as the sensing side and luminol at the anode as signal output side. Fe–N/C SACs could catalyze decomposition of H2O2 via their high catalase-like activity and then increase the Faraday current, which can boost the ECL of luminol due to the electroneutrality in a closed BPE system. Meanwhile, in the presence of the target, glucose oxidase (GOx)-Au NPs-Ab2 was introduced through specific immunoreaction, which catalyzes the formation of H2O2.

Herein, FeNi dual-single-atoms were efficiently encapsulated into N,P-codoped 3D hierarchically porous carbon (FeNi DSAs/N,P-PC) by a simple one-step pyrolysis. The resulting FeNi DSAs/N,P-PC catalyst exhibited the better ORR activity with the positive onset potential (Eonset = 1.02 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.88 V) over commercial Pt/C, and performed well in the assembled zinc-air batteries (peak power density of 124.73 mW cm−2,and long-term charge/discharge stable cycling for 330 h). The XAFS analysis clearly displayed the coordination structure and interactions of the FeNi dual atoms. The DFT calculations show that P-O bonds have great influence on the electronic structure of the FeNi dual atoms. And Ni site can effectively modulate the electronic structure of the Fe site to promote charge transfer and further reduce the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Reversible hydrogen storage via Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is one of the key technologies for efficient utilization of hydrogen energy. How to construct efficient dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts that enable low-temperature catalysis still remains challenging. Herein, we present the design and construction of single-atom Co-N-C(x) catalysts allowing significantly improved acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ). By varying the ligand/Co ratio, the optimal Co-N-C(1.5) can achieve 97.5% dehydrogenated product and 0.82 h−1 TOF value at ambient temperature, overperforming many reported non-noble metal even noble metal catalysts. This catalyst exhibits good recyclability and substrate versatility, enabling ambient temperature dehydrogenation of various N-heterocycles and efficient reverse hydrogenation of aromatic N-heterocycles, thus achieving the loop of reversible hydrogen storage. The active catalyst centers consist of specific Co-Nx moieties and nitrogen species within the carbon support. Controlled experiments reveal that the different performance of Co-N-C(x) is determined by density of the Co-Nx, and the rate-determining step of THQ dehydrogenation is correlated with the bond cleavages in surface-bound THQ.

The Ru@Silicalite-1-Sn-50 sample with tightly coupled redox and acidic sites exhibited high catalytic activity (T90% = 287 °C for toluene oxidation and T90% = 361 °C for DCM oxidation at a space velocity of 40,000 mL/(g h); specific reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOFRu) for toluene oxidation at 170 °C were 9.67 μmol/(gcat h) and 0.98 × 10−3 s−1, and specific reaction rate and TOFRu for DCM oxidation at 200 °C were 3.84 μmol/(gcat h) and 0.46 × 10−3 s−1, respectively), excellent catalytic stability (within 100 h of on-stream oxidation at 380 °C), and effective inhibition of toxic chlorine-containing by-products formation in the oxidation of (DCM and toluene). The doping of Sn could effectively anchor the Ru atoms to result in single-atom dispersion of Ru and generate oxygen vacancies, and optimized the synergistic interaction between Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid sites. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies and enriched Brønsted acid sites promoted the cleavage of C−Cl bonds in DCM and accelerated the desorption of Cl species as inorganic chlorine. In the meanwhile, the strong electron transfer within the Sn−O−Si bond increased the Lewis acidity, which promoted the deep oxidation of dechlorinated intermediates/other intermediates over Ru@Silicalite-1-Sn-50.

Catalytic liquid-phase dhydrogenation of nitrobenzene is a main industrial production method for aniline. However, the separation and recovery of the catalyst from the liquid hydrogenation system remain challenging. Graphene-encapsulated transition-metal nanoparticles (TM@G, where TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) exhibit magnetic separability and electron transfer effects, making them widely applicable in heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, a magnetically separable catalyst support, comprising graphene-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (Ni@NG), was developed. This support was then loaded with a Pt metal catalyst for efficient catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. To fabricate the catalyst support, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and Ni(OH)2 were uniformly mixed in deionized water until the solution turned blue at 90°C. The resulting blue solid precursor was then dried and annealed at 600°C in argon to yield the magnetic support (Ni@NG). The support was then characterized using Raman spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and XPS. TEM results revealed that the Ni@NG support exhibited a typical core-shell structure (with nanoscale Ni particles as the core and 2-5 layers of graphene as the shell). The Raman spectrum of the Ni@NG support exhibited the characteristic D and G bands of graphene at 1341 and 1604 cm-1, respectively. Moreover, the XRD spectrum of this support exhibited distinct peaks corresponding to Ni and graphene, while its XPS analysis confirmed the presence of an approximate nitrogen atom concentration of 3.64% in the nitrogen-doped graphene shell. Furthermore, the deposition-precipitation method was employed to synthesize a Pt-loaded Ni@NG catalyst (Pt/ Ni@NG), which was later used in the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in a liquid-phase reaction. Results revealed that increasing the Pt weight loading (mass fraction) from 0.1% to 0.5% altered the Pt dispersion state from single atoms to clusters and then to particles. In particular, at a Pt weight loading of 0.3%, the Pt/Ni@NG catalyst dominated by Pt clusters exhibited the highest activity for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. At this Pt weight loading, the catalyst achieved a turnover frequency of 27239.2 h-1 at 1 MPa reaction pressure under 30°C, completely converting nitrobenzene to aniline within 60 min. Furthermore, the Pt/Ni@NG catalyst maintained its activity over five testing cycles, attributed to its excellent liquid-phase magnetic separability.',\n",

The selectivity of Co-SACs is achieved by carefully regulating the coordination microenvironment of Co. The local electric field of the Co centers was identified as the key driver for the selective formation of reactive oxygen species from PMS. By precisely adjusting the symmetry of the Co coordination structure to establish a local electric field, Co-P1N3@C with a highly asymmetric local electric field enables the 100% nonradical activation of PMS through O-H bond cleavage.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Significant advancements in the activity of nitrogen-coordinated iron single-atom catalysts (Fe–N–C) have attracted attention as potential alternatives to Pt-based cathodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, their limited stability in acidic environments hinders their practical application. Moreover, achieving a synchronous enhancement of both the activity and stability of the Fe sites while preventing demetallation or carbon corrosion remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a synthesis method for Fe–N–C is introduced that exhibits remarkable durability, featuring a protective carbon encapsulation formed by applying an additional heterocyclic organic compound coating. It is demonstrated that stability can be enhanced by converting edge-rich Fe sites into highly stable FeN4 moieties through precise control of the robustness and packing density of the carbon encapsulation. Furthermore, electrochemical redox behavior along with in situ spectroscopies and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry provide insights into the structural characteristics of each Fe site and their stabilities. The accelerated stress testing and a long-term test (>100 h) exhibit that the robust carbon encapsulation can successfully prevent corrosion of carbon support and ensure durable Fe sites during operation.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single atom catalyst (SAC) is one of the most efficient and versatile catalysts with well-defined active sites. However, its facile and large-scale preparation, the prerequisite of industrial applications, has been very challenging. This dilemma originates from the Gibbs–Thomson effect, which renders it rather difficult to achieve high single atom loading (< 3 mol%). Further, most synthesizing procedures are quite complex, resulting in significant mass loss and thus low yields. Herein, a novel metal coordination route is developed to address these issues simultaneously, which is realized owing to the rapid complexation between ligands (e.g., biuret) and metal ions in aqueous solutions and subsequent in situ polymerization of the formed complexes to yield SACs. The whole preparation process involves only one heating step operated in air without any special protecting atmospheres, showing general applicability for diverse transition metals. Take Cu SAC for an example, a record yield of up to 3.565 kg in one pot and an ultrahigh metal loading 16.03 mol% on carbon nitride (Cu/CN) are approached. The as-prepared SACs are demonstrated to possess high activity, outstanding selectivity, and robust cyclicity for CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH. This research explores a robust route toward cost-effective, massive production of SACs for potential industrial applications.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single atom catalysts (SACs) are atomic-level-engineered materials with high intrinsic activity. Catalytic centers of SACs are typically the transition metal (TM)–nonmetal coordination sites, while the functions of coexisting non-TM-bonded functionalities are usually overlooked in catalysis. Herein, the scalable preparation of carbon-supported cobalt-anchored SACs (CoCN) with controlled Co─N sites and free functional N species is reported. The role of metal- and nonmetal-bonded functionalities in the SACs for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-driven Fenton-like reactions is first systematically studied, revealing their contribution to performance improvement and pathway steering. Experiments and computations demonstrate that the Co─N3C coordination plays a vital role in the formation of a surface-confined PMS* complex to trigger the electron transfer pathway and promote kinetics because of the optimized electronic state of Co centers, while the nonmetal-coordinated graphitic N sites act as preferable pollutant adsorption sites and additional PMS activation sites to accelerate electron transfer. Synergistically, CoCN exhibits ultrahigh activity in PMS activation for p-hydroxybenzoic acid oxidation, achieving complete degradation within 10 min with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.38 min−1, surpassing most reported materials. These findings offer new insights into the versatile functions of N species in SACs and inspire rational design of high-performance catalysts in complicated heterogeneous systems.',\n",

It facilitates the formation of a structure containing oxygen species between FeN4 and graphene, which provides high activity and stability for the ORR. These catalysts possess an enormous number of active sites and exhibit enhanced activity toward the alkaline ORR. They demonstrate excellent performance when applied to real electrochemical devices, such as zinc–air batteries and anion exchange membrane fuel cells.

However, these catalysts still face the dual challenges of low density and low utilization of active sites in practical applications. Hence, a simultaneous modulation strategy to construct high-density and accessible Co-N4 sites on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CoH SA/NC), is reported. As expected, the optimized CoH SA/NC catalyst exhibits superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential value of 0.874 V, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Importantly, the mass activity and turnover frequency of CoH SA/NC are 14.7 and 13.3 times higher than that of low-density Co single atom catalyst (CoL SA/NC), respectively. Structural characterization and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that the porous structure and the high dense Co-N4 sites synergistically improve the ORR performance, in which the high dense Co-N4 sites induced a redistribution of the d orbital, resulting in dz2 orbital has enough electron to interact with the OOH* specie, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR.

Here, it is reported that single-atom Fe-incorporated carbon nitride (Fe-CN-650) can effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal. Through some characterization techniques and DFT calculation, it is proved that Fe single atoms in Fe-CN-650 exist mainly in the form of Fe-N3O1 coordination, and Fe-N3O1 exhibited better affinity for PMS than the traditional Fe-N4 structure. The degradation rate constant of SMX in the Fe-CN-650/PMS system reached 0.472 min−1, and 90.80% of SMX can still be effectively degraded within 10 min after five consecutive recovery cycles.

Despite the existence of different nitrate reduction pathways, selectively directing the reaction pathway on the road to NH3 is now hindered by the absence of efficient catalysts. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are extensively investigated in a wide range of catalytic processes.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to accomplish the CO2 net emission. Ni-based single-atom catalysts (Ni-SACs) with the Ni-N-C structure have been the hotspot in this field. However, its catalytic activity is still unsatisfied. Regulation of the coordination environment of the active site via heteroatom doping is an efficient strategy to improve its catalytic characteristics and activity. Herein, the heteroatom phosphorus is introduced into the N-doped carbon supporter to form Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst achieving the CO Faraday efficiency of 91.8 % at a potential of -1.1 V along with the CO current density 91.2 mA cm-2 in the flow cell, which is superior to the sample Ni-SA/CN without P dopant. It is attributed that the more defects are built in the Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst due to the different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms. Moreover, the gap between d-band center and Femi energy level is narrowed due to the doped P atoms, which reduces the rate-limiting barrier height leading to the promoted catalytic performance. The cooperation of various items finally results in the overall performance. This work provides a simple method for establishing single-atom catalysts with P doping to improve catalytic performance for CO2RR.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Electrocatalytic CO2RR is an ideal method. It is capable of converting CO2 into usable fuels and valuable chemical products. Electrocatalytic CO2RR produces a wide range of chemicals. Of these, ethanol (EtOH) is favored for its wide industrial and commercial value. However, electrocatalytic CO2RR preparation of EtOH involves C-C coupling reactions and is a multi-electron transfer process. For this reason, the efficient electrochemical conversion of EtOH by CO2RR remains a great challenge. The preparation of EtOH by electrocatalytic CO2RR involves the interference of a competing hydrogen evolution reaction as well as some other reaction intermediates. This limits the improvement of Faraday efficiency of ethanol (FEEtOH) and the current density of ethanol (JEtOH). To improve ethanol selectivity, the researchers designed and modified the catalysts using engineering regulation effects such as reaction conditions engineering regulation, surface engineering regulation, interfacial engineering regulation, and single atom engineering regulation, and achieved excellent results. Therefore, it is important to understand the key factors affecting the catalyst activity by different engineering regulations and to apply a combination of engineering regulations to the catalyst development. Therefore, this paper firstly provides a comprehensive summary of the catalysts applied for the preparation of EtOH by electrocatalytic CO2RR, including two major categories of catalysts containing pure metal active components and catalysts without pure metal active components. Subsequently, the main effects of engineering modulation on catalyst activity are analyzed and summarized in detail, respectively. Finally, the future challenges and development prospects of electrocatalytic CO2RR for EtOH preparation were highlighted.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Graphitic carbon nitride has gained considerable attention as a visible-light photocatalyst. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is restricted by its limited capacity for absorbing visible light and swift recombination of charge carriers. To overcome this bottleneck, we fabricated an atomic Fe-dispersed ultrathin carbon nitride (Fe-UTCN) photocatalyst via one-step thermal polymerization. Fe-UTCN showed high efficiency in the photodegradation of acetaminophen (APAP), achieving > 90 % elimination within 60-min visible light irradiation. The anchoring of Fe atoms improved the photocatalytic activity of UTCN by narrowing the bandgap from 2.50 eV to 2.33 eV and suppressing radiative recombination. Calculations by density functional theory revealed that the Fe–N4 sites (adsorption energy of − 3.10 eV) were preferred over the UTCN sites (adsorption energy of − 0.18 eV) for the adsorption of oxygen and the subsequent formation of O2•−, the dominant reactive species in the degradation of APAP. Notably, the Fe-UTCN catalyst exhibited good stability after five successive runs and was applicable to complex water matrices. Therefore, Fe-UTCN, a noble-metal-free photocatalyst, is a promising candidate for visible light-driven water decontamination.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single-atom sites. Fabricating high-density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could optimize the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, which exhibited great potential to break performance limitations and deepen mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic behavior governed by neighbouring single atoms is particularly elusive and has yet to be understood. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms contributes to superior performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms. Neighbouring single atoms was achieved by fabricating high-density single atoms to narrow the distance between single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the Nei-Ir1/CoGaOOH with neighbouring Ir single atoms exhibited a low overpotential of 170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and long-durable stability over 2000 h for oxygen evolution. Mechanistic studies revealed that neighbouring single atoms synergetic stabilized the *OOH intermediates via extra hydrogen bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers, as compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could offer guidance for the development of efficient electrocatalysts, thus accelerating the world‘s transition to sustainable energy.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Hydroformylation reactions promoted by Rh single-atom catalysts typically exhibit a negative reaction order for CO and a positive reaction order for H2 and alkenes. To enhance the catalytic activity, efforts have been concentrated on reducing the CO adsorption strength and/or enhancing the hydrogenation capacity at Rh sites. This report introduces an optimized Rh single-atom catalyst, utilizing positively charged Mn species to weaken the CO adsorption strength. Our strategy involves placing MnOx clusters in the proximity to the Rh single atom. This arrangement allows the reduction of Rh3+ to produce electronically deficient Rhδ+ species (1 < δ < 2), rather than the usual formation of the lower valence state Rh+ species. The weakened CO adsorption strength on the more positively charged Rhδ+ results in reduced CO coverage on the Rh active site, and enhanced adsorption of propylene. Our mechanistic study reveals that H2 and CO adsorption on Rh catalyzes the reduction of adjacent Mn(IV) species, inducing the formation of a Rh-MnOx paired active site. The neighboring MnOx clusters hinder the extensive reduction of Rh3+ to Rh+. This study presents MnOx as an inorganic ligand in Rh-MnOx pair site modifies the electronic properties of Rh sites to modulate the hydroformylation activity of Rh single-atom catalysts.',\n",

In this study, we design a single atomic Pt promoted CoMo heterostructure catalyst for ethanol synthesis from sorbitol, one of the important biochemical platforms, via a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. The Pt1/CoMoO4 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance with 99.6% sorbitol conversion and 71.6% EtOH selectivity over a 30 h reaction. A combination of Raman, XPS, XANES, EXAFS, Py-FTIR, and operando EG-DRIFTS provides insight into the synergistic effects between Co0 and Mo5+ active sites during sorbitol hydrogenolysis to EtOH over Pt1/CoMoO4 catalyst. Additionally, it is discovered that the Pt1 single atom promoter activates hydrogen and tunes the electronic properties of Co and Mo species, resulting in forming the highest content of Co0 and Mo5+ active sites with higher stability and promoting the sorbitol hydrogenolysis to EtOH. This work demonstrates the validity of designing efficient catalysts with synergistic multi-active sites.

Herein, a strategy for regulating the electronic structure of double-site Mn2-N6 by axial traction of Mn cluster is presented. The atomically dispersed homonuclear double-site Mn2-N6 was synthesized. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations revealed that the oxygen adsorption capacity of double-site Mn2-N6 was stronger than that of Mn-N4, which can improve the weak adsorption of oxygen at isolated Mn active sites. The introduction of Mn clusters broke the planar structure of Mn2-N6 through axial traction, further altering the electron configuration around the active sites and effectively decreasing the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates and reaction energy barriers, leading to increased intrinsic activity, which greatly improved the ORR performance (E1/2 = 0.91 V).

The atom economy of this reaction, with water as the sole byproduct, entails a complex mechanism in which alcohol activation can follow multiple competing pathways. The interest in single atom catalysts (SACs) combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems motivated this computational study on BH catalyzed by nickel SACs. We found that the oxidation, charge, and spin states of the system, as well as the geometry of the support, all have a strong influence on the BH mechanism. The pyrrolic support was the most reactive in a dicationic state with nearly degenerate singlet and triplet configurations. The free energy of the catalyst hydrogenation by H2 was strongly correlated to its reactivity, thus being a useful descriptor. Further, the mechanism followed an unusual reaction pathway in which the support takes and delivers the H equivalents, with the metal playing a spectator role. This study provides useful insights for the further development of BH SACs.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The hybrid catalysts have demonstrated decent catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the specific roles and interactions of different species contributing to the activity remain ambiguous. Here we synthesized Pt hybrid catalysts through the ligand preprotected pyrolysis method, which has demonstrated its universality for preparing Ir and Ru hybrid catalysts due to the unique constraining and pulling effects exerted by ligands. The hybrid catalysts demonstrated higher activity than single-component catalysts, such as Pt single atoms or Pt nanoparticles. Particularly, the Pt/CNT-600 hybrid catalyst displayed good HER activity with a low overpotential of 15 mV at −10 mA cm-2, and its mass activity was 8 times than that of Pt/C-20%. In hybrid catalysts, the synergistic effect via charge redistribution in the Pt1 and Ptn sites afforded the optimal Pt-H binding energy for fast HER kinetics. More importantly, it presented an intense dependence of charge distribution on the distance between Pt1 and Ptn sites, and the volcanic curve indicated the optimal distance of approximately 0.43 nm for the synergistic effect. Consequently, we proposed that the Ptn-mPt1 active units offered the dominant contribution to catalytic activity, resulting from the collective synergistic effect between Ptn and every adjacent Pt1 site. This study not only presents a universal method for synthesizing hybrid catalysts but also offers fresh insights into their rational design and activity enhancement by manipulating the intersite distance and interaction effect.',\n",

The activity is 6 times higher than that of the conventional Co3O4 catalyst (8.8 μmol h-1 cm-2). The catalytic activity and selectivity of Ag-Co3O4 originate from the interaction between atomically dispersed Ag and Co3O4, resulting in the formation of active octahedral Co2+ species (Co2+Oh) with an unpaired eg electron, which facilitates the activation and adsorption of NO3- ion and promotes the *NO2 adsorption, along with its transformation to *NO intermediate.

The two-dimensional semi-metallic carbon nitride g-C4N3 is an excellent candidate for electrochemical reactions owing to its eminent conductivity and stability. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) a series of low-budget non-noble transition metal single-atom (SAC) loaded on the g-C4N3 (named as TM@C4N3, TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were investigated as electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. Ni@C4N3 shows an enormous application potential as electrode material, with OER and ORR overpotentials of 0.59 V and 0.23 V, respectively. The second lowest binding energy between Ni and support g-C4N3 indicates that Ni@C4N3 possesses good overall stability. The d-band center as well as metal valence as the descriptor exhibit good agreement with the adsorption energy of the intermediate. A linear relationship exists among the adsorption energies of the three intermediates O, OH, and OOH, given the similarity that they are all bonded to the metal through one oxygen atom. By adjusting the adsorption energy of these intermediates, the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts can be tuned for OER and ORR.

The surface segregation of Co atoms that are encapsulated by less-active Cu atoms, induced by the adsorption of CO molecules, was already enabled at a low coverage of adsorbed CO, providing the energy required to displace the entire compact Co species inside the Cu matrices due to a notable adsorption preference of CO for the Co sites over the Cu ones.

Therefore, the development of non-PGM-based catalysts, especially the highly promising single-atom catalysts (SACs), has emerged as an effective solution to reduce costs. However, the insufficient long-term stability of SACs under PEMFC operating conditions severely hampers their practical application. Metal-support interactions (MSI) are generally considered an effective strategy for enhancing the stability of SACs. Consequently, this review explores the topic of enhancing the stability of SACs in the cathode of PEMFCs by constructing single-atom-supported metal catalysts with MSI. In the discussion, the degradation pathways of SACs are initially outlined, followed by an exploration of MSI principles, synthesis strategies for single-atom-supported metal catalysts based on MSI, and their applications in enhancing the stability of PEMFC cathodes. Finally, an overview is provided regarding the challenges in the future development of single-atom-supported metal catalysts.',\n",

FeNx-based catalysts have shown brilliant catalytic performance due to their unique electronic structures. In this work, the active FeN3 site is designed by doping Fe atom at the B-vacancy in BN monolayer without introducing additional N atoms. Our first principles calculation results show that the Fe atom has good dispersibility, dynamical stability and thermal stability on the BN monolayer. Two oxidation mechanisms (Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal) of HCHO on Fe-doped BN monolayer are investigated to explore the possible reaction pathways. The dissociation of O2 molecule is identified as the rate-limiting step, and the lowest energy barrier is 0.99 eV. Moreover, the excellent desorption behaviors of the produced CO2 and H2O molecules on substrate (small desorption energy of 0.20 and 0.75 eV, and short desorption time of 2.39 × 10−9 and 4.64 s) enable this catalyst to maintain high activity during the reaction cycle.

Even more surprisingly, the sintering takes place at rather mild conditions (He/Ar, 400–500 °C) but stops soon after it commences (within minutes). The lower the temperature of O2-pretreatment (500 → 20 °C), the sharper the further drop in metal dispersion, and one to a few cycles of the consecutive treatments could be sufficient for the unique properties of Pt clusters to be lost.

A variety of TM@β-Te SACs, constructed by 28 transition metal (TM) atoms anchoring on monovacant β-Te substrate, are systematically investigated by using DFT calculations. An efficient “six-step” screening scheme is proposed to screen out potential NRR catalysts, during which the implicit and explicit solvent models are involved to evaluate competitive reactions of H2O and H+. The final selected (Ta, W)@β-Te catalysts have limiting potentials (UL) of −0.32 V and −0.37 V, respectively. Three intrinsic descriptors of φ (the ratio of number of valence electrons and electronegativity of TM atom), ΔG∗N(adsorption energy of a single N atom on the substrate) and ICOHP (Crystal orbital Hamiltonian integrals for TM-N bonds) are proposed and their correlations with UL are investigated to expound the catalytic activity and mechanism. The relationships of dN≡N ∼ φ, ΔG∗N2∼ φ, ΔG∗N∼ φ and ICOHP ∼ φ resemble “volcanoes”, where (Ta, W)@β-Te are located near the vertex as potential catalysts, which can be verified by scaling relationship of ICOHP and ΔG∗N. Moreover, the UL ∼ φ, UL ∼ ΔG∗N and UL ∼ ICOHP can be used to determine the potential catalysts from rough catalyst screening to accurate determination of potential determining step (PDS) in catalytic reaction. The constant potential model is adopted to investigate the influences of electrode potentials on adsorption strength of NRR intermediates.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Indoor volatile formaldehyde is a serious health hazard. The development of low-temperature and efficient nonhomogeneous oxidation catalysts is crucial for protecting human health and the environment but is also quite challenging. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with active centers and coordination environments that are precisely tunable at the atomic level exhibit excellent catalytic activity in many catalytic fields. Among two-dimensional materials, the nonmagnetic monolayer material g-C3N4 may be a good platform for loading single atoms. In this study, the effect of nitrogen defect formation on the charge distribution of g-C3N4 is discussed in detail using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The effect of nitrogen defects on the activated molecular oxygen of Pt/C3N4 was systematically revealed by DFT calculations in combination with molecular orbital theory. Two typical reaction mechanisms for the catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde were proposed based on the Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanism. Pt/C3N4–V3N was more advantageous for path 1, as determined by the activation energy barrier of the rate-determining step and product desorption. Finally, the active centers and chemical structures of Pt/C3N4 and Pt/C3N4–V3N were verified to have good stability at 375 K by determination of the migration energy barriers and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, the formation of N defects can effectively anchor single-atom Pt and provide additional active sites, which in turn activate molecular oxygen to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of formaldehyde. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanism of formaldehyde oxidation by single-atom Pt catalysts and a new idea for the development of Pt as well as other metal-based single-atom oxidation catalysts.',\n",

Using an appropriate matrix to stabilize single-atom active centers with optimal geometric and electronic structures is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity.

In recent years, microbe-derived carbonaceous materials, characterized with abundant self-doping sites, have been continuously developed as cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To fully unlock the catalytic potential of microbe-derived carbonaceous materials, a comprehensive analysis of catalytic sites and mechanisms for ORR is essential. This paper provides a summary of the ORR catalytic performance of microbe-derived carbonaceous materials reported to date, with a specific focus on the self-doping sites introduced during their pyrolytic fabrication. It highlights the mono- or co-doping sites involving nonmetallic elements such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) atoms, as well as covers the doping of metallic iron (Fe) atoms with various coordination configurations in microbe-derived carbonaceous materials. Understanding the impact of these self-doping sites on ORR catalytic performance can guide the design of doping sites in microbe-derived carbonaceous materials.

Herein, uncalcined TS-1 supported Au-Pd bimetallic catalysts were prepared, and the relationship between the active-site structure and corresponding performance in the selective oxidation of propane with H2 and O2 in the gas phase was systematically investigated. In contrast to the liquid-phase reaction, trace Pd alloyed with Au triggered an increase in both catalytic activity and selectivity, in which Au20-Pd1/TS-1-B catalyst exhibited excellent activity (170 gAC·h−1·kgcat−1) and AC selectivity (90.6%), much higher than those of the Au/TS-1-B catalyst (AC formation rate of 100 gAC·h−1·kgcat−1 and AC selectivity of 86.3%). It was found that Pd was gradually isolated into monomers with the increase of Au/Pd molar ratio, and the synergy between Pd single atoms and Au improved the catalytic performance via enhancing hydrogen dissociation and modulating the electronic structure of Au. Furthermore, the reaction conditions were optimized based on the kinetics studies and the Au20-Pd1/TS-1-B catalyst exhibited enhanced H2 selectivity (45%) and long-term stability (over 130 h).

However, for catalyst systems where single atoms and nanoclusters coexist, how to identify the independent and synergistic effects of atomic sites and investigate the possible coexistence of multiple activation mechanisms still remains a great challenge. Herein, CuSA/CoOx-CeO2 catalysts with Cu single atoms and CoOx nanoclusters were fabricated for PMS activation. The introduction of Cu single atoms led to the reconstruction and diversification of catalytic active sites of CoOx-CeO2. The synergy between CoOx nanoclusters and neighboring Cu single atoms in CuSA/CoOx-CeO2 catalyst led to the 1O2 pathway of PMS activation, while the isolated Cu atom induced the Cu(III) oxidation pathway. The introducing of adjacent Cu single atoms caused the redistribution of the site charges in CoOx nanoclusters, which enhanced the charge transfer and promoted the adsorption and activation behavior of PMS molecules. During the evolution of 1O2, the synergistic effect of Cu single atoms and CoOx nanoclusters increased the stability of the reaction intermediate state (*OO*SO3), reducing the total Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) required for 1O2 formation. Compared with the cooperative site, the isolated Cu-O4 sites exhibited stronger charge transfer capacity to PMS molecules and were more conducive to the activation of the local substrate electronic structure, facilitating the formation and stabilization of Cu(III)–OH metastable intermediates. Overall, this study demonstrated the importance about the construction of multi-site induced multipath coexisting PMS activation system and the accurate identification of active sites.',\n",

Since the corresponding properties are highly structure-dependent, a suitable support is thus required to ensure cluster stability during operating conditions. Herein, an efficient method to stabilize cobalt nanoclusters on graphene grown on nickel substrates, exploiting the anchoring effect of nickel atoms incorporated in the carbon network is presented. The anchored nanoclusters are studied by in situ variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at different temperatures and upon gas exposure. Cluster stability upon annealing up to 200 °C and upon CO exposure at least up to 1 × 10−6 mbar CO partial pressure is demonstrated. Moreover, the dimensions of the cobalt nanoclusters remain surprisingly small (<3 nm diameter) with a narrow size distribution. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the interplay between the low diffusion barrier on graphene on nickel and the strong anchoring effect of the nickel atoms leads to the increased stability and size selectivity of these clusters. This anchoring technique is expected to be applicable also to other cases, with clear advantages for transition metals that are usually difficult to stabilize.',\n",

Herein, a dual anchoring strategy was employed to prepare highly stable Pt NPs loaded uniformly on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (MCHS) containing Fe single-atom (FeSA) active sites (PtNP-FeSA@MCHS). A combination of the mesoporous structure of MCHS with the electron transfer from Fe single-atom and Pt NPs (so called dual anchoring strategy) enables the Pt NPs anchored and uniformly dispersed over the whole matrix of FeSA@MCHS, endowing PtNP-FeSA@MCHS ultra-high ORR stability, with a decrease in half-wave potential of only 3 mV and the mass activity (MA) as well as specific activity (SA) attenuation of merely 5 % and 2 % after 20,000 cycles of the accelerated durability test (ADT), respectively, surpassing the most of Pt nanoparticles (NPs)-based ORR catalysts reported thus far. In particular, the TEM analysis for PtNP-FeSA@MCHS after the ADT revealed no significant aggregation of Pt NPs, thus showing the superior structural stability of PtNP-FeSA@MCHS. Furthermore, PtNP-FeSA@MCHS shows good activity with MA of 0.63 A mgPt−1 and SA of 1.22 mA cm−2, which are 4.5 and 6.8 times of 20 % Pt/C (MA = 0.14 A mgPt−1 and SA = 0.18 mA cm−2), respectively.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of catalysis due to their excellent catalytic ability and enhanced atomic utilization, but the multi-mode single-atom nanozymes for biosensors remain a challenging issue. In this work, iron-doped carbon dots (Fe CDs) were loaded onto the edges and pores of Mo SACs with nanoflower morphology; accordingly, a composite material Fe CDs/Mo SACs was prepared successfully, which improves the catalytic performance and develops a fluorescence mode without changing the original morphology. The steady-state kinetic data indicates that the material prepared have better affinity for substrates and faster reaction rates under optimized conditions. The specific kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were calculated as 0.39 mM and 7.502×10−7 M·s−1 respectively. The excellent peroxidase-like activity of Fe CDs/Mo SACs allows H2O2 to decompose into •OH, which in turn oxidizes colorless o-phenylenediamine (OPD) to yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). At the same time, the fluorescence signal of Fe CDs/Mo SACs quenches obviously by DAP at 460 nm through internal filtration effect (IFE), while the characteristic fluorescence response of DAP gradually increases at 590 nm. Based on this sensing mechanism, a sensitive and accurate dual-mode (colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent) sensor was constructed to detect H2O2 and uric acid, and the rate of recovery and linearity were acceptable for the detection of UA in human serum and urine samples. This method provides a new strategy for rapid and sensitive detection of UA, and also broadens the development of SACs in the field of biosensors.',\n",

In this strategy, the Co2+ ions are first absorbed into oxygen-rich porous carbon nanosheets and further form the Co-SAs with the help of thiourea in the following pyrolysis procedure, which is believed to be able to confine the generated Co9S8 nanoparticles into carbon frameworks due to their interface interaction.

However, slow reaction kinetics and high activation energy at the sulfur cathode pose great challenges for the practical applications. Herein, biomass-derived carbon with single-atomic cobalt sites (MMPC-Co) is synthesized as the cathode in Zn-S batteries. The catalysis of single-atom Co sites greatly promotes the transform of cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on the cathode surface, while offering accelerated charge transfer rate for high conversion reversibility and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for high electrocatalytic current. Furthermore, the rich pore structure not only physically limits sulfur loss, but also accelerates the transport of zinc ions. In addition, the large pore volume of MMPC-Co is able to relieve the stress effect caused by the volume expansion of ZnS during charge/discharge cycles, thereby maintaining the stability of electrode structure. Consequently, the sulfur cathode maintains a high specific capacity of 729.96 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 4 A g−1, which is much better than most cathode materials reported in the literature.

For the MNx site, breaking the symmetrical geometry and charge distribution by introducing relatively weak electronegative atoms into the first/second shell is an efficient way, but it remains challenging for elucidating the underlying mechanism of interaction. Herein, a practical strategy was reported to rationally design single cobalt atoms coordinated with both phosphorus and nitrogen atoms in a hierarchically porous carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks.

We further studied the alkaline behavior of neighboring potassium single atoms by carbon dioxide chemisorption and quantum calculations. Results show biodiesel yield of 99.6% at room temperature, which is explained by a good local photothermal effect at the solar interface and the presence of superalkali sites in the atomic potassium-containing biomaterial.

In this study, an iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe─N─C) catalyst is intentionally designed through a carbon-thermal-diffusion strategy, exposing extensively the carbon-defective Fe─N4 sites within a micro-mesoporous carbon matrix. The optimization of Fe─N4 sites results in exceptional catalytic ozonation efficiency, surpassing that of intact Fe─N4 sites and commercial MnO2 by 10 and 312 times, respectively. Theoretical calculations and experimental data demonstrated that carbon-defect engineering induces selective cleavage of C─N bond neighboring the Fe─N4 motif. This induces an increase in non-uniform charges and Fermi density, leading to elevated energy levels at the center of Fe d-band. Compared to the intact atomic configuration, carbon-defective Fe─N4 site is more activated to strengthen the interaction with O3 and weaken the O─O bond, thereby reducing the barriers for highly active surface atomic oxygen (*O/*OO), ultimately achieving efficient oxidation of CH3SH and its intermediates.

In a H2─O2 fuel cell assembled with Fe─N─C/TiN, it presents 980 mA cm−2 current density at 0.6 V, 880 mW cm−2 peak power density, and only 17 mV voltage loss at 0.80 A cm−2 after 10 kilo-cycle ADT. The experiment and calculation results prove that the TiN has a strong adsorption interaction for the free radical intermediates (such as *OH, *OOH, etc.), and the radicals are scavenged subsequently. The rational integration of Fe single-atom, TiN radical scavenger, and highly porous network adequately utilize the intrinsic advantages of composite structure, enabling a durable and active Pt-metal-free catalyst for PEMFC.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Recently, coupling the conventional low Pt-group-metal (low-PGM, LP) and emerging PGM-free (PF) moiety to form a composite LP/PF catalyst is proposed to be an advanced strategy to improve the intrinsic activity and stability of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Milestones in terms of ORR mass activity are created by this type of catalyst. However, the specific synergy between LP and PF moieties has not been well elucidated. Herein, two model catalysts are synthesized, i.e., atomically dispersed Co/N/C supporting Pt single atoms (Co/N/C@Pt-SAs) and PtCo nanoparticles (Co/N/C@PtCo-NPs). Interestingly, the Co/N/C@PtCo-NPs catalyst presents higher ORR mass activity prior to Co/N/C@Pt-SAs. This is theoretically due to the dual “built-in electric field” in Co/N/C@PtCo-NPs: one electric field with a direction from Pt to Co in NPs and another from Pt to Co/N/C; that is, Pt gains higher electron density in Co/N/C@PtCo-NPs than that in Co/N/C@Pt-SAs, thus forming an asymmetric electron cloud, and regulating the adsorption and activation of oxygen-containing species. In addition, the existence of Co significantly decreases the average valence state of PtCo NPs, indicating a stronger affinity between PtCo NPs and Co/N/C substrate, to account for the enhanced stability.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by transition-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) is promising for practical applications in energy-conversion devices, but great challenges still remain due to the sluggish kinetics of O═O cleavage. Herein, a kind of high-density iron network-like sites catalysts are constructed with optimized intermetallic distances on an amino-functionalized carbon matrix (Fe-HDNSs). Quasi-in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ synchrotron infrared characterizations demonstrate that the optimized intermetallic distances in Fe-HDNSs can in situ activate the molecular oxygen by fast electron compensation through the hybridized Fe 3d‒O 2p, which efficiently facilitates the cleavage of the O═O bond to *O species and highly suppresses the side reactions for an accelerated kinetics of the 4e− ORR. As a result, the well-designed Fe-HDNSs catalysts exhibit superior performances with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a kinetic current density of 72 mA cm−2@0.80 V versus RHE, exceeding most of the noble-metal-free ORR catalysts.

Reducing the pressure inhibits aggregation substantially, resulting in almost three times higher single-atom loadings than those obtained at ambient pressure. Molecular dynamics and computational fluid dynamics simulations reveal the role of a metal hopping mechanism, maximizing the metal atom distribution through an increased probability of metal-ligand binding.

The controllable modification of single-atom sites through asymmetric coordination with a second heteroatom offers new opportunities for enhancing the intrinsic activity of transition metal single-atom catalysts. Here, we prepared the asymmetric N/P hybrid coordination of single-atom Co1-N3P1 by absorbing the Co-P complex on ZIF-8 using a concise impregnation-pyrolysis process. The catalyst exhibits ultrahigh activity and selectivity in the N-alkylation of aniline and benzyl alcohol, achieving a turnover number (TON) value of 3480 and a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 174-h. The TON value is 1 order of magnitude higher than the reported catalysts and even 37-fold higher than that of the homogeneous catalyst CoCl2(PPh3)2. Furthermore, the catalyst maintains its high activity and selectivity even after 6 cycles of usage. Controlling experiments and isotope labeling experiments confirm that in the asymmetric Co1-N3P1 system, the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol proceeds via a transfer hydrogenation mechanism involving the monohydride route. Theoretical calculations prove that the superior activity of asymmetric Co1-N3P1 is attributed to the higher d-band energy level of Co sites, which leads to a more stable four-membered ring transition state and a lower reaction energy barrier compared to symmetrical Co1-N4',\n",

Benefiting from the multienzyme-like activities of CeO2, ROS generated from FeNC is instantaneously eliminated to alleviate the corrosion of carbon and demetallization of metal sites. Consequently, FeNC/CeO2 exhibits better ORR durability with a decay of only 5 mV compared to FeNC (18 mV) in neutral electrolyte after 10k cycles.

Here, we screen out Ni-N4 and Cu-N4 catalysts for highly efficient nitrite electroreduction to NH2OH by adopting density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT calculations reveal that the high selectivity of Ni-N4 and Cu-N4 is ascribed to their weak adsorption of *NH2OH and *NH intermediates, thereby preventing the further reduction of NH2OH. Moreover, using *NO as a model intermediate, we studied the relationship between the 3d orbital occupancy and adsorption strength of the intermediate. It is found that Ni-N4 and Cu-N4 with fully occupied dxz, dyz, and dz2 orbitals have poor adsorption of *NO intermediate.

In this study, our theoretical calculations reveal that the active sites with different states of copper atoms (1-3-5-7-9) play a pivotal role in the adsorption behavior of the *CHO critical intermediate. This behavior dictates the subsequent hydrogenation and coupling steps, ultimately influencing the formation of the desired products. Consequently, we designed two model electrocatalysts comprising Cu single atoms and particles supported on CeO2. This design enables controlled *CHO intermediate transformation through either hydrogenation with *H or coupling with *CO, leading to a highly selective CO2RR. Notably, our selective control strategy tunes the Faradaic efficiency from 61.1% for ethylene (C2H4) to 61.2% for methane (CH4). Additionally, the catalyst demonstrated a high current density and remarkable stability, exceeding 500 h of operation.

Herein, we report a new SAC bearing Fe-N3C-N sites with asymmetric in-plane coordinated Fe-N3C and axial coordinated N atom for ORR, which was obtained by pyrolysis of an iron isoporphyrin on polyvinylimidazole (PVI) coated carbon black. The C@PVI-(NCTPP)Fe-800 catalyst exhibited significantly improved ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.89 V vs RHE) than the counterpart SAC with Fe-N4-N sites in 0.1 M KOH. Significantly, the Zn-air batteries equipped with the C@PVI-(NCTPP)Fe-800 catalyst demonstrated an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.45 V and a peak power density (Pmax) of 130 mW/cm2, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst (OCV = 1.42 V; Pmax = 119 mW/cm2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the d-band center of the asymmetric Fe-N3C-N structure shifted upward, which enhances its electron-donating ability, favors O2 adsorption, and supports O-O bond activation, thus leading to significantly promoted catalytic activity.

Here, an efficient and stabilized Cu(I) single atoms-modified W18O49 nanowires (Cu1/W18O49) photocatalyst with asymmetric Cu─W dual sites is reported for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H4. The interconversion between W(V) and W(VI) in W18O49 ensures the stability of Cu(I) during the photocatalytic process. Under light irradiation, the optimal Cu1/W18O49 (3.6-Cu1/W18O49) catalyst exhibits concurrent high activity and selectivity toward C2H4 production, reaching a corresponding yield rate of 4.9 µmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity as high as 72.8%, respectively. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations reveal that Cu(I) single atoms stabilize the *CO intermediate, and the asymmetric Cu─W dual sites effectively reduce the energy barrier for the C─C coupling of two neighboring CO intermediates, enabling the highly selective C2H4 generation from CO2 photoreduction. This work demonstrates leveraging stabilized atomically-dispersed Cu(I) in asymmetric dual-sites for selective CO2-to-C2H4 conversion and can provide new insight into photocatalytic CO2 reduction to other targeted C2+ products through rational construction of active sites for C─C coupling.',\n",

The compressive strain is generated by depositing Co single atoms on highly arced carbon layers with ultra-small curvature radii ≈2 nm.

In this work, we prepared an atom-economical Fe-N5 single-atom catalyst (SAC) with only environmental S atom doping, which was synthesized by pyrolyzing an axial imidazole-coordinated thiophene iron porphyrin precursor on PVI-functionalized carbon black. Due to the electron-donating properties of thiophene-S atoms, the intrinsic activity of the Fe-N5 site was significantly promoted by regulating the electronic configuration through the long-range interaction, thus lowering the energy barrier of the ORR.

However, most studies have focused solely on investigating the RWGS reaction over catalysts with high Cu and Fe loadings, thus leading to an increase in the complexity of the catalytic system and, hence, preventing the gain of any reliable information about the nature of the active sites and reaction mechanism. In this work, a CeO2-supported single-atom Cu catalyst modified with iron was synthesized and evaluated for the RWGS reaction. The catalytic results reveal a significant synergistic effect between CuCeO2 and Fe, demonstrating an activity up to three times higher than the combined catalytic activities of monometallic catalysts (Fe/CeO2 + CuCeO2) under identical conditions. Various ex situ and in situ/operando techniques are employed to unveil the concealed role of Fe in catalyst activity enhancement. The combined findings from hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) reveal that the added Fe predominantly interacts with Cu-containing surface sites, resulting in the stabilization of higher proportions of Cu single sites. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and operando EPR results unveil a synergistic interplay of Fe with Cu-containing sites and CeOx domains, efficiently enhancing both the reoxidation of Cu+ in Cu+-Ov-Ce3+ moieties and the reducibility of Ce4+ in CeOx domains under RWGS conditions.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Modulating the metal-support interfacial structure to achieve coke elimination is highly desired for low-temperature CH4/CO2 reforming. Nonetheless, explicit effects of optimizing the supported metal size and catalyst support properties remain convoluted and sometimes controversial. Herein, we designed different Pt-CeO2 interfaces by tuning the surface reactive oxygen (SRO) from ceria and the in situ aggregated nanoparticle size developed from single-atom Pt as independent parameters. Intriguingly, the often-emphasized nominal Pt size effect (0.3-10.5 nm) is secondary due to carbon deposition, while the catalyst with a high SRO concentration exhibits outstanding reactivity. We demonstrated that the SRO from ceria corrects the nominal supported metal size effect in controlling the low-temperature CH4/CO2 reforming reactivity. Specifically, in the Pt-Ox-Ce interfacial microstructure, SRO oxidizes the deposited carbon as an oxygen reservoir, making interfacial Pt atoms remain active from coke, and therefore determines the reactivity rather than the nominal Pt species size. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies explained the reaction mechanism of SRO and carbon elimination. This work provides new insights for coke-resistant catalyst design and the coke elimination mechanism.',\n",

However, the low metal loading (<1.0 wt.%) and the difficulty in precisely modulating their coordination configurations hinder the practical yield of target products and the understanding of actual reaction mechanisms. To overcome these obstacles, a series of strategies are proposed to design SACs with a precise coordination configuration and/or a high density of active sites. For an insightful and comprehensive understanding of these strategies, it is worth analyzing and categorizing them according to their intrinsic mechanisms and applicational perspectives. In this review, the synthesis strategies of precise and/or high-density SACs are first summarized. Moreover, taking typical electrochemical processes, including oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, metal–sulfur batteries, etc., as examples, the applications of these SACs are discussed, focusing on their advantages in enhancing the yield of target products, improving the efficiency of energy storage, and revealing the unique effects. Finally, the challenges and perspective of precise modulation and densification of metal sites for SACs are proposed.

A curvature-activity relationship was constructed through energy decomposition analysis and scaling relation fitting. Originating from the bending of the carbon skeleton, the Fe atom migrates from the N4 plane, leading to formally inequivalent dsp2+x hybridization and surface-dependent structural distortion. A larger distortion energy and a weaker orbital interaction jointly destabilize the intermediates of ORR inside the tubes and depress the overpotential in comparison to that on graphene and the convex side of CNTs. The closed cavity of CNT also affects the interactions between adsorbates and water molecules in the confined space.

However, Fe–N–C catalysts are vulnerable to attack from reactive oxygen species, resulting in inferior durability, and current strategies failing to balance the activity and stability. Here, this study reports Fe and Ce single atoms coupled catalysts anchored on ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe/Ce–N–C) as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst for PEMFCs. In PEMFC tests, the maximum power density of Fe/Ce–N–C catalyst reached up to 0.82 W cm−2, which is 41% larger than that of Fe–N–C. More importantly, the activity of Fe/Ce–N–C catalyst only decreased by 21% after 30 000 cycles under H2/air condition. Density functional theory reveals that the strong coupling between the Fe and Ce sites result in the redistribution of electrons in the active sites, which optimizes the adsorption of OH* intermediates on the catalyst and increases the intrinsic activity. Additionally, the admirable radical scavenging ability of the Ce sites ensured that the catalysts gained long-term stability. Therefore, the addition of Ce single atoms provides a new strategy for improving the activity and durability of oxygen reduction catalysts.',\n",

In this paper, a novel master-double guest vulcanization-assisted strategy is reported for synthesizing Fe single-atom catalysts on N,S codoped porous hollow leaf carbon (FeSA/N,S-PHLC) with highly exposed FeN3SOH sites. Fe(mIm) (guest I) is loaded on the surface of ZIF-L (host) and then trithiocyanuric acid (TCA, guest II) is bonded with Fe(mIm), and the resulting ZIF-L@Fe(mIm)@TCA precursors can be converted to FeSA/N,S-PHLC with controllable structures. In addition, XPS analysis yield an increase in pyridine N content in FeSA/N,S-PHLC compared to FeSA/N-PHLC. It can be demonstrated by theoretical calculations that the N,S-coordinated axially hydroxy-coordinated asymmetric Fe centers synergistically with the abundance of pyridinic nitrogen facilitate the adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates, and the 3d orbitals of the Fe active centers can be optimized.

Herein, the aim is to overcome this challenge by creating a Fe single atom catalyst on a 2D defect-containing nitrogen-doped carbon support (Fe1/DNC) via a microenvironment engineering strategy. Microkinetic modeling reveals that FeN4(OH) moieties are the real active sites under reaction conditions.

Herein, through facile doping alkali metals in Pt catalyst on zirconia (Pt-Na/ZrO2), the atomically dispersed Ptδ+-O(OH)x- associated with alkali metal via oxygen bridge was successfully fabricated. This novel catalyst presented remarkably higher CO and hydrocarbon (HCs: C3H8, C7H8, C3H6, and CH4) oxidation activity than its counterpart (Pt/ZrO2). Systematically direct and solid evidence from experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the fabricated electron-rich Ptδ+-O(OH)x- related to Na species rather than the original Ptδ+-O(OH)x-, serving as the catalytically active species, can readily react with CO adsorbed on Ptδ+ to produce CO2 with significantly decreasing energy barrier in the rate-determining step from 1.97 to 0.93 eV. Additionally, owing to the strongly adsorbed and activated water by Na species, those fabricated single-site Ptδ+-O(OH)x- linked by Na species could be easily regenerated during the oxidation reaction, thus considerably boosting its oxidation reactivity and durability. Such facile construction of the alkali ion-linked active hydroxyl group was also realized by Li and K modification which could guide to the design of efficient catalysts for the removal of CO and HCs from industrial exhaust.',\n",

In this study, we combined density functional theory calculations and the unit bond index-quadratic exponential potential approximation to investigate the first CH4 dehydrogenation in the TM/(CeO2)10 system, where TM represents a single transition-metal specie (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) supported in the compact (CeO2)10 cluster. In addition, substrate size effects will be addressed by comparing our results with previous surface science studies by our group. We found a direct correlation between the magnitude of the TM adsorption energy on the CeO2 substrates (hollow and bridge sites) and the magnitude of charge transfer from the TM adatoms to the substrates, while CH4 has a weaker physisorption binding energy to the ceria cluster and the surface substrates. Molecular fragments derived from CH4 (CH3 and H) bind through chemisorption interactions to the TM and O sites, respectively. The estimated energy barrier for the cleavage of the C-H bond is lower when the reaction occurs in the cluster rather than on the surface. The molecular fragments exhibited better stabilization on cluster substrates, resulting in an exergonic dehydrogenation reaction; whereas, for surfaces, the reaction was endergonic. Among the selected TM species, Fe and Co adatoms are promising candidates for the first CH4 dehydrogenation on CeO2 substrates, which can be explained by the magnitude of the metal-support interaction and stabilization of the CH3 specie, which results in the lowest barriers among the evaluated transition metals.',\n",

Herein, we perform systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic simulations to shed light on the activity and selectivity trends of ethanol relative to three competing by-products in syngas conversion, which quantitatively unveils the key determining factors on the transition metal-based catalysts. The scaling relations involved are revealed as functions of the adsorption energies of C and O species (EC and EO), and the three-dimensional activity and selectivity surfaces are constructed quantitatively, indicating that the optimal condition (peak position) correspond to EC = -6.10 eV and EO = -5.70 eV. Furthermore, we find that ethanol activity at the peak is primarily constrained by the kinetic barriers of CH3O dissociation and the coupling reaction of CH3 and CO, while its selectivity can be enhanced by increasing the energy barrier of CH3 hydrogenation and strengthening the adsorption of CH3CHO. More significantly, following these rules, the single-atom metal alloy catalysts (i.e., Cu1Co, Cu1Ni) are identified that could serve as promising candidates for ethanol synthesis, which are superior to the common alloy-type catalysts.

Herein, co-pyrolysis of BC derived from shrimp shells and N-containing supramolecular organic frameworks with a hexagonal cavity structure of Fe3+–N3 (Fe–SOFs) was, for the first time, used to prepare an efficient and inexpensive BC-based Fe–SAC (Fe–MCA@SS). The Fe–N bond was successfully grafted from Fe–SOFs onto BC and subsequently transformed into monoatomic Fe–pyridinic N4. Moreover, Fe–MCA@SS successfully triggered an efficient nonradical PMS process, degrading 94.5 % of aniline (AN) within 5 min. Mediated electron transfer (MET) mechanism was primarily responsible for AN removal. MET was attributed to the following factors: the synergistic effect of the stronger chemical adsorption of PMS with an Fe atom in Fe–pyridinic N4 active sites, the higher redox potential of [Fe–MCA@SS/PMS]*, and the value of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of AN being larger than the value of highest occupied molecular orbital of [Fe–MCA@SS/PMS]*. This study sheds new light on the preparation of BC-based SACs catalyst with efficient nonradical oxidation ability and an excellent feasibility to remove electron-rich organic pollutants in groundwater.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Hydrogen production via low-temperature (<550 °C) steam reforming of methane (SRM) has attracted increasing research attention due to its importance as an alternative, efficient, and environmentally benign energy carrier. The thermodynamic limitation of low-temperature SRM can be eased by process design such as using a membrane reactor or an adsorption-enhanced reforming process, and an active low-temperature SRM catalyst with high stability would be indispensable. Herein, we report a 2 wt% Ir/TiO2 catalyst that exhibits high methane conversion activity in low-temperature SRM with a relatively high turnover frequency (TOF) and a low activation energy in comparison with the literature. Long-term catalyst stability test demonstrates a good resistance to coking and sintering during low-temperature SRM reactions. In situ spectroscopy analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the small Ir clusters and Ir single atoms (SAs) are both active for methane conversion, while the clusters exhibit higher activity than SAs for low-temperature SRM reaction. Microkinetic simulation based on DFT calculations shows consistent product formation temperatures and the simulation nicely reproduces the product distribution observed in experimental analysis, which confirms the superior SRM activity of the TiO2-supported Ir clusters in this work.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric reactions have played a pivotal role in the synthesis of functional chiral molecules. However, the ambiguous mechanism involving several plausible catalytically active species, the potential for catalyst deactivation and the need for constant reusability remain key challenges. Heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts are highly desirable, but their performance has been hampered by low density and stability of catalytically active sites. Herein, we have devised a versatile methodology for fabricating highly efficient and robust chiral heterogeneous single-Rh-site catalysts by direct polymerization. The successful anchoring of single Rh-ligand species, the amplification of enantioselective inductive ability and the uniform distribution of atomic Rh sites within the resulting polymer matrix are identified as crucial factors contributing to their exceptional catalytic performance via comprehensive characterization and controlled experiments. In contrast to the corresponding homogeneous analogues, these chiral single-Rhodium-site catalysts exhibit outstanding performance, yielding enhanced enantioselectivity and broad applicability, even accommodating various functional groups. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just half catalyst dosage. Furthermore, their industrial potential is demonstrated through successful utilization in continuous flow processes and robust batch recycling. In future, we aim to expand the horizons of heterogeneous chiral single-metal-site catalysis, and bring us a step closer to practical asymmetric synthesis.',\n",

Herein, a sequential pyrolyzing and phosphating approach for a well-designed GO/CoTPP gel precursor has been explored to prepare a Co-based carbon catalyst containing single-atom Co-Nx and hollow Co2P active species (Co2P/Co-N-C) for multifunctional electrocatalytic reactions. Kirkendall effect occurring during the template-free one-pot phosphating approach induced the formation of the hollow Co2P structure in the catalyst, simultaneously optimizing the electron structure and allowing the active sites to be exposed to a greater extent. DFT calculations demonstrated that the Co2P and Co-Nx structures enable Co2P/Co-N-C to have a suitable d-band center depending on the electron transfer from Co2P to Co-Nx, which enhances the adsorption of O* and the dissociation of OH* in oxygen electrode reactions, thereby facilitates catalytic reactions. As a result, the Co2P/Co-N-C exhibits excellent trifunctional activity with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V in alkaline for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), overpotentials of 330 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 190 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, which are among the best results reported to date for Co-containing carbon-based catalysts. Furthermore, the flexible Zinc-air battery with Co2P/Co-N-C electrodes also demonstrates a high open circuit voltage of 1.35 V, which is applied to build the self-powered device for water splitting continuously.

Nevertheless, determining how various nitrogen species and active metal centres coordinate on an atomic scale remains unclear and inadequately explained. Herein, we demonstrate a soft-template-aided technique using Fe-containing molecules (e.g. iron phthalocyanine [FePc], Fe-1,10-phenanthroline [Fe-Phen] and Fe-glucose) to enhance the performance of Fe-SACs in terms of ORR. In this technique, FePc molecules can be converted into atomically dispersed pyrrolic-type iron–nitrogen (FeN4) sites during a pyrolytic process.

As per the findings from control experiments and characterisation studies, electron transfer between the support and the active Fe centre amplifies the ORR performance. Theoretical calculations substantiate that Fe sites coordinated with pyrrolic N atoms govern the electronic configuration of the catalysis, reducing the free energy absorption of reaction intermediates and thus increasing its intrinsic ORR capability.

In photocatalytic experiments, Mn/TiO2 photocatalyst removed 100 % of HCHO at a low concentration of 7.6 ppm, and reaching excellent mineralization efficiency of over 99.6 %. According to the proposed reaction mechanism, O2 spontaneously adsorbs onto the Mn/TiO2 surface, forming two adsorbed O- after electron donation into the π2p* antibonding orbitals of O2. The adsorbed O- then reacts with gaseous HCHO to produce the key intermediate dioxymethylene (DOM), finally fulfilling a more favorable oxidation process on the Mn/TiO2 surface.

Herein, N or B doped Fe-embedded graphyne (Fe-GY), Fe-nXGYm (n = 1, 2, 3; X = N, B; m = 1, 2, 3), are employed as probes to reveal the effect of the coordination environment engineering on CO2RR performance via heteroatom doping in SACs. The results show that the doping position and number of N or B in Fe-GY significantly affects catalyst activity and CO2RR product selectivity. In comparison, Fe-1NGY exhibits high-performance CO2RR to CH4 with a low limiting potential of −0.17 V, and Fe-2NGY3 is demonstrated as an excellent CO2RR electrocatalyst for producing HCOOH with a low limiting potential of −0.16 V. With applied potential, Fe-GY, Fe-1NGY, and Fe-2NGY3 exhibit significant advantages in CO2RR to CH4 while hydrogen evolution reaction is inhibited. The intrinsic essence analysis illustrates that heteroatom doping modulates the electronic structure of active sites and regulates the adsorption strength of the intermediates, thereby rendering a favorable coordination environment for CO2RR. This work highlights Fe-nXGYm as outstanding SACs for CO2RR, and provides an in-depth insight into the intrinsic essence of the promotion effect from heteroatom doping.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The catalytic behaviors of metal for syngas conversion are related to the carbonization of the metal，however，the formed metallic carbides are of complicated composition and structures，making the identification of the active phase of the catalysts be challengeable，so it is significant to investigate the role of the carbon component of the catalysts. In this work，we studied computationally mechanisms of syngas conversion to alcohols on single atom Mo supported on pristine graphene（Mo/pri-graphene）and single-carbon vacant graphene（Mo/sv-graphene）by means of density functional theory（DFT）method to explore the regulated effect of carbon component on C—O activation. The results show that it is significantly different for mechanisms of syngas conversion on Mo/pri-graphene with weak Mo-C interactions and Mo/sv-graphene with strong Mo-C interactions. On Mo/pri-graphene the preferred pathway is CO→HCO→CH2O→CH3O→CH3/CH4，and species CH3O is of some stability due to high activation free energy of its further transformation into CH3/CH4，while on Mo/sv-graphene the preferred pathway is CO→HCO→CH2O→ CH2OH→CH3OH/CH3（CH4），and the coexistence of species CH3OH and CH3（CH4）provides a possibility for the following carbon chain propagation. The activation free energy of the elementary steps of CO hydrogenation on Mo/sv-graphene is generally lower than that on Mo/pri-graphene. The reasons are the lower interactions between Mo/sv-graphene and the substrate，and the participation of the carbon component of Mo/sv-graphene during the activation/transformation of the substrate. Thus，the carbon component of catalysts can regulate（and/or take participate in）the interaction of the catalysts with the substrates，and then make an improvement on the activity and selectivity.',\n",

Under hydroformylation reaction conditions, operando spectroscopic investigations unravel the presence of both single atoms and clusters and detected at first propanal and then methanol. We find that the formation of methanol is associated with CO hydrogenation over Rh clusters which was further confirmed under CO hydrogenation conditions at elevated pressure. The activity of catalysts synthesized via a precipitation (PP) method over various supports towards the hydroformylation reaction follows the order: Rh/ZrO2 > Rh/CeO2 > Rh/MgO. Comparing Rh/CeO2 catalysts synthesized via different methods, catalysts prepared by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) showed catalytic activity for the hydroformylation reaction at lower temperatures (413 K), whereas catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (WI) showed the highest stability.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'It is important to tune the coordination configuration of dual-atom catalyst (DAC), especially in the first coordination sphere, to render high intrinsic catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Herein, a type of atomically dispersed and boron-coordinated DAC structure, namely, FeN4B-NiN4B dual sites, is reported. In this structure, the incorporation of boron into the first coordination sphere of FeN4/NiN4 atomic sites regulates its geometry and electronic structure by forming “Fe-B-N” and “Ni-B-N” bridges. The FeN4B-NiN4B DAC exhibits much enhanced ORR and OER property compared to the FeN4-NiN4 counterparts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the boron-induced charge transfer and asymmetric charge distributions of the central Fe/Ni atoms optimize the adsorption and desorption behavior of the ORR/OER intermediates and reduce the activation energy for the potential-determining step. Zinc-air batteries employing the FeN4B-NiN4B cathode exhibit a high maximum power density (236.9 mW cm−2) and stable cyclability up to 1100 h.

Precise synthesis of nanoclusters and single atoms coexisting chiral catalysts provide a promising pathway for enhancing asymmetric catalytic performance. Herein, chiral electrode catalysts are fabricated comprising gold clusters (R-AuC) and single atoms (R-AuS) on graphene oxide (R-AuC/S@GO) through an assembly-irradiation strategy. Thereinto, the R-Aus is in situ generated from R-AuC under light irradiation. The monoatomization process can be precisely regulated by changing the wavelength of the light, resulting in four Au-based chiral electrode (R-Au@GO) catalysts with different ratios of nanoclusters and single atoms. These chiral electrodes are applied in the electrocatalytic enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl benzoylformate (MB) to chiral methyl mandelate (S-MM), and the R-AuC/S-2@GO with ≈26% R-AuC and 74% R-AuS achieve the highest catalytic activity (35 µmol cm−2 h−1 productivity) and enantioselectivity [97% enantiomeric excess (ee)].

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The elevation of the low-temperature oxidation activity for Pt/CeO2 catalysts is challenging to meet the increasingly stringent requirements for effectively eliminating carbon monoxide (CO) from automobile exhaust. Although reducing activation is a facile strategy for boosting reactivity, past research has mainly concentrated on applying H2 as the reductant, ignoring the reduction capabilities of CO itself, a prevalent component of automobile exhaust. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt/CeO2 was fabricated and activated by CO, which could lower the 90% conversion temperature (T90) by 256 °C and achieve a 20-fold higher CO consumption rate at 200 °C. The activated Pt/CeO2 catalysts showed exceptional catalytic oxidation activity and robust hydrothermal stability under the simulated working conditions for gasoline or diesel exhausts. Characterization results illustrated that the CO activation triggered the formation of a large portion of Pt0 terrace sites, acting as inherent active sites for CO oxidation. Besides, CO activation weakened the Pt-O-Ce bond strength to generate a surface oxygen vacancy (Vo). It served as the oxygen reservoir to store the dissociated oxygen and convert it into active dioxygen intermediates. Conversely, H2 activation failed to stimulate Vo, but triggered a deactivating transformation of the Pt nanocluster into inactive PtxOy in the presence of oxygen. The present work offers coherent insight into the upsurging effect of CO activation on Pt/CeO2, aiming to set up a valuable avenue in elevating the efficiency of eliminating CO, C3H6, and NH3 from automobile exhaust.',\n",

In comparison to NH3-SCR, CO-SCR can achieve synergistic control of CO and NO pollutants, making it a powerful denitrification technology that treats waste with waste. Unfortunately, the competitive adsorption of O2 and NO on CO-SCR catalysts inhibits efficient conversion of NOx under O2-containing conditions. In this work, we obtained two Ir sites with different electron densities, Ir1 single atoms in the oxidized Irδ+ state and Ir0 nanoparticles in the metallic state, by controlled pretreatment of the Ir/ZSM-5 catalyst with H2 at 200 °C. The coexistence of Ir1 single atoms and Ir0 nanoparticles on ZSM-5 creates a synergistic effect, which facilitates the reduction of NO through CO in the presence of O2, following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The ONNO dimer is formed on the Ir1 single atom sites and then spills over to the neighboring Ir0 nanoparticles for subsequent reduction to N2 by CO.

There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe−N−C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single-atom Fe catalyst with the co-coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe−N/O−C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d-orbital spin-electron filling of Fe sites by fine-tuning the first coordination shell.

DACs feature sites containing pairs of metal atoms and can outperform SACs due to their additional binding possibilities. Yet quantifying the improved catalytic activity in terms of proximity effects remains difficult, as it requires both high-resolution kinetic data and an understanding of the reaction pathways. Here, we use an automated bubble counter setup for comparing the catalytic performance of ceria-supported platinum SACs and DACs in ammonia borane hydrolysis. The catalysts were synthesized by wet impregnation and characterized using SEM, HAADF-STEM, XRD, XPS, and CO-DRIFTS. High-precision kinetic studies of ammonia borane hydrolysis in the presence of SACs show two temperature-dependent regions, with a transition point at 43 °C. Conversely, the DACs show only one regime. We show that this is because DACs preorganize both ammonia borane and water at the dual-atom active site. The additional proximal Pt atom improves the reaction rate 3-fold and enables faster reactions at lower temperatures. We suggest that the DACs enable the activation of the water-O-H bond as well as increase the hydrogen spillover effect due to the adjacent Pt site. Interestingly, using ammonia borane hydrolysis as a benchmark reaction gives further insight into hydrogen spillover mechanisms, above what is known from the CO oxidation studies.',\n",

The Pt single atom (Pt SA) site can promote the cleavage of two C-H bonds in propane to yield propylene via direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDHP), whereas the Pt-MXene interface facilitates the cleavage of the C-O bond in CO2 and the hydrogenation of O* to H2O via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS). Degree of rate control and Brönsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) correlation analyses revealed that the binding strength of Pt toward C3H7* and that of MXene toward O* determined the DDHP and RWGS activities, respectively. The DDHP activity is also highly correlated with the d-band center of the Pt SA and the work function of the Pt1@MXene surface. Microkinetic simulations showed that the Pt SA anchored on Mo2CO2 and W2CO2 possessed superior DDHP activity than the Pt(111) surface, although only Pt1@Mo2CO2 presented high activities in both DDHP and RWGS.

Co(IV)=O demonstrated an ingenious oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reaction to achieve the efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and this allowed robust operation in various complex environments. The axial S coordination modulated the 3d orbital electron distribution of the Co atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the axial S coordination decreased the energy barrier for PMS desorption and lowered the free energy change (ΔG) for Co(IV)=O generation. CoN4S-PMS* had a narrow d-band close to the Fermi level, which enhanced charge transfer to accelerate the cleavage of O-O and O-H bonds in PMS.

The results indicate that introducing TiO2 into Al2O3 promoted the residual electrons from Al2O3 surface directionally transmitted to the interface formed by the loaded Cu13 cluster and the support surface, thus created the electron-rich active interface. Incorporating single atom Ga promoter further gathered the residual electrons and stabilized the loaded Cu13 clusters. The electron-rich property of the active interface promoted the chemical adsorption and activation of both CO2 and the generated carbonyl species. Further favors the hydrogenating of carbonyl intermediates to methanol and effectively enhances the methanol selectivity. Moreover, CO2 priors to hydrogenated to methanol via reverse water gas shift pathway over Cu13/Ga-AT computational model with changed reaction rate controlling step with reduced activation energy.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Electrochemical water splitting is expected to be a promising solution to the growing problem of fossil fuel depletion, but is limited by the slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Currently, nanomaterials such as Ru/Ir-based noble metal compounds have been used as highly active electrocatalysts for OER, but the high cost and scarcity hinder their wide application. Therefore, it is crucial to develop OER electrocatalysts that combine economic efficiency with high catalytic performance. In this work, we propose a universal synthesis strategy for the preparation of various noble metals-doped 3d-transition metal oxides (NM-TMO) electrocatalysts by the salt-template method. Our characterization analyses demonstrate that the noble metals are homogeneously dispersed as single atoms in transition metal oxides. Notably, Ir-doped Co3O4 catalysts, with Ir content as low as 1.35 at% (Ir-Co3O4), exhibit excellent OER performance in acidic, alkaline, and neutral media, compared to commercial IrO2 as well as undoped Co3O4. This work demonstrates that the synthesis method is applicable to a wide range of noble metals and 3d-transition metal oxide matrix. This method results in reduced costs by significantly decreasing the noble metal, but improving catalytic performance.',\n",

Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main-group Sb−N−C single-atom catalysts is reported. Significantly, Sb−N−C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e− pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g−1 at 0.65 V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e− pathway with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89 V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C.

However, its application for groundwater remediation is hindered by the scavenging side reaction of H2 evolution. Herein, we report that a composite material (Fe0@Fe-N4-C), consisting of zerovalent iron (Fe0) nanoparticles and nitrogen-coordinated single-atom Fe (Fe-N4), can effectively steer H* toward reductive dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE), a common groundwater contaminant and primary risk driver at many hazardous waste sites. The Fe-N4 structure strengthens the bond between surface Fe atoms and H*, inhibiting H2 evolution. Nonetheless, H* is available for dechlorination, as the adsorption of TCE weakens this bond. Interestingly, H* also enhances electron delocalization and transfer between adsorbed TCE and surface Fe atoms, increasing the reactivity of adsorbed TCE with H*. Consequently, Fe0@Fe-N4-C exhibits high electron selectivity (up to 86%) toward dechlorination, as well as a high TCE degradation kinetic constant. This material is resilient against water matrix interferences, achieving long-lasting performance for effective TCE removal.

In this work, n–p codoping engineering is introduced to account for the modulation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on a two-dimensional (2D) bismuth-oxyhalide-based cathode by using first-principles calculation. n–p codoping is established via the Coulomb interactions between the negatively charged TM SACs and the positively charged Cl vacancy (VCl) in the dopant–defect pairs. Based on the formation energy of charged defects, neutral dopant–defect pairs for the Fe, Co, and Ni SACs (PTM0) and the −1e charge state of the Cu SAC-based pair (PCu−1) are stable. The electrostatic attraction of the n–p codoping strengthens the stability and solubility of TM SACs by neutralizing the oppositely charged VCl defect and TM dopant. The n–p codoping stabilizes the electron accumulation around the TM SACs. Accumulated electrons modify the d-orbital alignment and shift the d-band center toward the Fermi level, enhancing the reducing capacity of TM SACs based on the d-band theory. Besides the electrostatic attraction of the n–p codoping, the PCu−1 also accumulates additional electrons surrounding Cu SACs and forms a half-occupied dx2−y2 state, which further upshifts the d-band center and improves photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The metastability of Cl multivacancies limits the concentration of the n–p pairs with Cl multivacancies (PTM@nCl (n > 1)).

Here, we report for first time mechanistic insights into the Fischer-Tropsch-type (FTT) synthesis of ethanol (CH3CH2OH), through ketene (CH2CO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) intermediates, and methane (CH4) via a chain growing mechanism using a single-Fe atom supported on silica (SiO2) surfaces as a heterogeneous astrocatalyst. Methods. Quantum chemical simulations based on extended periodic surfaces were carried out to characterize the potential energy surfaces of the FTT chain growing mechanism. Calculations of the binding energies of reaction intermediates and products and Ricea-Ramspergera-Kassela-Marcus kinetic calculations were performed to evaluate catalytic efficiencies and determine the feasibility of the reactions in different astrophysical environments. Results. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the FTT chain growing mechanism enters into direct competition with FTT methanol formation, since formation of the CH2 chain growth initiator is feasible. The coupling of the CH2 with CO (forming ketene) and subsequent H2 additions yield acetaldehyde and finally ethanol, while direct H2 addition to CH2 produces methane. Thermodynamically, both processes are largely exergonic, but they present energy barriers that require external energy inputs to be overcome. Kinetic calculations demonstrate the strong temperature dependency of the FTT processes as tunneling does not dominate. Conclusions. The results could explain the presence of CH3CH2OH and CH4 in diverse astrophysical regions where current models fail to reproduce their observational quantities. The evidence that the chain growing mechanism is operating opens a new reactivity paradigm toward the formation of complex organic molecules, which is constrained by the temperature-dependent behaviour of the FTT reactions and by making their energy features a crucial aspect.',\n",

Through various dynamic quasi in-situ characterizations, we found that coke preferentially covered Rh clusters, thereby inhibiting C–C bond breaking and methane formation. Meanwhile, Rh single atoms were less affected by coke coverage and remained exposed as active and selective sites for PDH, favoring propylene production. This work underscores the sensitivity of PDH to the sizes of Rh species, with isolated Rh single atoms promoting propylene formation.',\n",

Herein, this study systematically investigated the potential of 3d transition metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) positioned at graphene single vacancies (TM@CSV), as well as double vacancies (TM@CDV), for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using first-principles. The exploration encompassed substrate stability, CO2 adsorption, and the HER as the main competing reaction. Through the careful screening of 20 catalysts formed by Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn doped graphene defects, several promising catalysts were identified: Sc@CSV situated on graphene single vacancies, Sc@CDV and Ti@CDV situated on graphene double vacancies. They could not only effectively adsorb CO2 molecules, but also inhibit HER, the main competing reaction. In assessing their performance in CO2RR, all exhibited selectivity toward HCOOH. Notably, Sc@CDV demonstrated the best selectivity, requiring the lowest ΔG (0.96 eV) for efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH. Electronic structure analysis revealed that Sc@CDV outperforms due to its optimal balance between ΔG of hydrogenation and the product desorption achieved through a moderate number of active electrons.',\n",

Evaluating the impact of the medium’s pH is essential for achieving selective H2O2 production at higher current density through continuous O2 supply to gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) in membrane electrolyzers. We investigated the effect of electrolyte pH on both H2O2 production and the flooding behavior of GDEs loaded with a cobalt single-atom catalyst in a typical H-type cell. The electrocatalyst was prepared by heating cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin loaded on Ketjen Black (CoTPP/KB) at 750 °C. Remarkably, the cobalt single-atom catalyst exhibited high current density when the top of the hydrophobic gas-diffusion layer was exposed to the gas phase, facilitating efficient O2 diffusion within the GDE. Potential-time curves at −40 mA cm-2 showed stable potentials and Faradaic efficiencies (>80%) over 5 h across a pH range from 1 to 10, with the H2O2 concentration reaching approximately 100 mmol L-1 at pH 1.0. In contrast, the potential at pH 13 decreased abruptly in 3 h due to the flooding of GDE. Long-term tests demonstrated stable electrocatalytic H2O2 production only in the acidic electrolytes for 24 h, attributed to reduced flooding with decreasing pH. These findings underscore the impact of electrolyte pH on GDE performance during H2O2 production via the 2e- ORR, with acidity favoring the mitigation of undesirable flooding behavior.',\n",

Iron oxides usually present as hematite (α-Fe2O3), maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), and magnetite (Fe3O4), where the coordination environments of Fe and O vary considerably. The diversity structures of iron oxides, in terms of chemical composition, particle size/shape, and crystal-phase, favor a flexible mediation on the geometric and electronic characters of surface Fe and O atoms that are intimately linked to the active sites for catalysis. Tuning the crystal-phase of size/shape-specified FeOx particles alters the arrangements of Fe and O atoms both in the bulk and on the surface. While tailoring the particle shape, in a specific crystal-phase, enables to expose the more reactive facets featured by unique arrangements of Fe and O atoms. All these strategies could maximize the number of active sites for catalysis and regulate the adsorption and activation manner of reacting molecules. In addition, the shape and crystal-phase of FeOx particles, when they are used to support the catalytically more active precious metals, affect the dispersion of the precious-metals via interfacial bonding and charge transfer. In this context, the precious-metals would show distinct electronic features via interaction with iron oxides, while their interfacial bonding is governed by the surface properties of iron oxides. Among them, precious-metal single-atoms, anchored on iron oxides, are characterized by the isolated sites, but a straightforward correlation between their electronic and geometric structures and the catalytic properties is controversial. Alternatively, inverse structures (iron-oxide layers on precious -metal particles) and core-shell geometries (a precious-metal core and an oxide shell) enable to construct active interfaces and describe the geometric and electronic characters.

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose doping different transition metal (TM) atoms to regulate the electronic structures of the two-dimensional 1T-HfTe2 monolayer to achieve bifunctional catalysis for the ORR/OER. Due to the small electronegativity of the Hf atom, we found the doped TM atoms can generally form anion centers by accepting abundant charges from the Hf interlayer. At the same time, the highly conductive 1T-HfTe2 contributes to the charge transfer between the active center and the reaction intermediates, rendering the designed SACs the tunable activity for the reactions. By comparing the theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER on 15 single-atom catalysts (SACs), Pt-doped system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, outperforming the traditional Pt(1 1 1) and RuO2(1 1 0) catalysts.

While there has been exciting progress in SAA research for various thermal catalytic reactions in the last decade, the design, application, and characterization of SAA catalysts in electrocatalysis remain nascent with intriguing uncertainties and ample opportunities. We highlight the recent research findings in this growing area, where the SAAs, owing to their unique doped metal properties and atomically precise bimetallic synergies, promote selective reaction pathways by tuning binding energies and distributions of adsorbates/intermediates. We also provide our perspective on this growing research area's potential challenges and opportunities.\",\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'We provide the rational design of dual atom catalysts (DACs) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through high-throughput computational screening of M1M2N6-DAC systems, where M1 and M2 represent Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, or Pt metals. We predict that FeRuN6-DAC at the summit of the volcano plot exhibits a low theoretical ORR overpotential (ηORR) of 0.24 V and a low theoretical OER overpotential (ηOER) of 0.19 V. The low ηORR and ηOER result from the catalytic performance of the Fe site being tuned to electronic properties that facilitate adsorption and desorption of the OH* intermediate. Inspired by these hybrid density functional theory (DFT) computational and machine learning (ML) results, we synthesized FeRuN6-DAC, FeN4-SAC, and RuN4-SAC and characterized them using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and in-situ electron spin resonance (ESR). Our in-situ ESR spectroscopy signifies that the spin of the Fe active site increases with increasing applied potential due to the increase in the concentration of OH* intermediate on Fe. We verified experimentally the predicted catalytic performances, finding that FeRuN6-DAC leads to an experimental ORR overpotential of 0.29 V with a Tafel slope of 104 mVdec−1 and an OER overpotential of 0.27 V with a Tafel slope of 124 mVdec−1. The rechargeable Zinc-air battery setup was fabricated with FeRuN6-DAC in place of the cathode, showing a maximum power density of 0.45 W/cm2 at the current density of 0.44 A/cm2 and good stability after 120 cycles. According to our findings, we demonstrate that DFT-guided strategies are useful for designing advanced DACs applicable to ORR, OER, and Zinc-air battery applications.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal sulfide and single-atom catalysts are attractive materials and their excellent performance play an important role in various fields. In this study, we investigate the sensing properties of Ni-decorated MoS2 towards dopamine (DA) molecule by using first-principles method. Ni is identified as the primary anchoring point for the DA molecule. We further examine the synergistic effect of intrinsic defects on the system and find that they significantly influence the adsorption behavior. The presence of a Mo defect leads to a 7 % increase in the adsorption energy compared to the scenario without any defects. By applying an in-plane voltage to these models, the I–V curve and conductivity are calculated to simulate the experimental detectability. The detection sensitivity can be significantly improved by suitable in-plane voltage. By applying a back-gate electric field, the influence of interface charge transfer on the adsorption characteristics of DA is investigated, and the back-gate electric field brings a significant enhancement of the adsorption energy, with an impressive increase up to 34 %. This study provides valuable insights into the sensing properties of DA by assessing the adsorption energy and suggests possible avenues for improving the detection sensitivity.',\n",

Hereby, we present a series of operando/in situ spectroscopic experiments for DO of waste sludge palm oil (WSPO) by using atomically dispersed La-W bimetallic supported AC catalysts (La-W/AC) with well-defined structures. The La(5%)-W(2%)/AC catalyst prepared through co-precipitation (CP) process rendered high surface area (741 m2/g) and catalyst's acidity (13319.16 µmol/g). Besides, the catalyst demonstrated a superior catalytic performance of DO reactivity under optimal reaction conditions of 0.5 % catalyst loading (CL), a one hour reaction time (Rt), and 250 °C reaction temperature (RT), achieving 98 % WSPO conversion to green fuel turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.0153 s-1.

Besides, in situ XAS spectroscopy consolidates the oxidation state of La and W, where the presence of metal centre, support and substrate were confirmed to reflect the occurrence of palmitic acid DO on atomically dispersed La and W active sites.

Various electrocatalytic methods, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction reactions, play central roles in overcoming these obstacles. In addition to being cost-effective, the unique structural configuration of single-atom catalysts (SACs) allows the maximum use of each atom and has garnered considerable interest. However, the simplicity of the SAC structure often leads to reduced metal content and elevated surface energy, thereby limiting its performance in real-life electrocatalytic applications, particularly those involving multi-step reactions. Thus, researchers have explored an array of designs for SACs that synergistically combine particles (including clusters) to enhance electrocatalytic performance with improved charge transfer and separation. This study comprehensively explores several synthetic strategies for SACs and highlights the synergistic effects achieved by combining SACs with particles, including clusters. Furthermore, it delves into the underlying mechanisms governing their interactions such as electron transfer, bifunctional effects, and tandem effects.

       "  'ABSTRACT': \"There are still challenges in producing noble metal catalysts with atomic dispersion on a large scale in current. This study presents a method for preparing a highly dispersed Pt catalyst (Pt/CeOx/DMS) by modifying dendritic mesoporous SiO2 (DMS) with CeOx 'islands'. The results demonstrate that Pt is highly dispersed on the CeOx/DMS carrier, with the majority of Pt existing in the form of single atoms (Pt/20 wt.% CeOx/DMS). The dendritic DMS has a large specific area (451 m2 g−1) that provides more sites for the formation of CeOx 'islands'. This promotes the dispersion of Pt, significantly improving the oxidation activity of CO. The addition of CeOx 'islands' to the Pt/DMS catalyst promotes the desorption of CO on Pt NPs, enhances the adsorption and activation of O2, and further improves the activity of catalyst. This is because of the synergistic effect between Pt and CeOx 'islands'. The DFT result found that it is more beneficial for Pt1 to adsorb O2 before other reactions. To test the activity and stability of the catalyst, the team conducted catalytic oxidation of CO as a model reaction. The results show that the promotion of CeOx 'island' reduces T90 of CO catalytic oxidation by 16 ℃. In the high-temperature stability test of the catalyst, it was observed that even after reacting at 500 ℃ for 8 h, the catalyst can still achieve 90 % conversion of CO at 147 ℃, demonstrating its good stability. This study provides a foundation for designing a new type of CO oxidation catalyst. The catalyst features high dispersion Pt and exhibits excellent catalytic activity.\",\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'A fuel cell involving CO2/H2 is an appealing energy system to convert CO2 into synthetic fuels as well as to generate electricity using only waste heat. However, overcoming the inherent activation barrier of CO2 to improve the CO2 conversion rate in CO2/H2 fuel cell is still challenging. Herein, we report a synergistic electron-donor and proton-repulsion group composed of Pt-N3-S-C sites to simultaneously modulate the electronic structure and CO2-protonation ability of Ru nanoclusters (RuNC) in RuNC/Pt-N3-S-C catalyst. Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that Pt-N3-S sites not only function as electron donors to Ru nanoclusters to cooperatively induce the orbital hybridization of Ru 3d and the antibonding orbitals of CO2, affording the dissociation of C[dbnd]O bonds in CO2, but also as electronic structure “modulator” to create new active sites on the surface of RuNC to effectively activate molecular CO2. More importantly, an internal polarization field between Pt-N3-S-C and RuNC additionally makes single atom Pt sites repel protons while Ru atoms serve as proton capturers via hydrogen spillover effect, resulting in accelerated protonation of CO2. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic activities for CO2 reduction with a conversion rate of 559.1 μmol gcat−1 h−1. This approach helps with fine tuning the electronic structures and catalytic CO2 protonation ability of catalysts for thermal-coupled electrocatalysis.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Modulation strategies are widely developed to regulate electronic state of single-atom catalysts (SACs) to reinforce the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the modulation effect using only single coordination regulation is often insufficient to optimize the electronic and geometric structure of metal active centers. Herein, a general strategy to modify the activity of single-atomic Fe site is achieved by dual decoration of Fe centers with contiguous sulfur atoms and metal nanoclusters via an aggregation-redispersion route. Under near-range engagement, the adjacent S atoms and Fe nanoclusters can break the symmetric electronic interface of Fe-N moiety, and act as the modulators to synergistically tune the electronic configurations of Fe centers, leading to less electron transfer to *OH, and subsequent favorable desorption. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical results reinforces the significant roles of S atoms and metal clusters in tandem by correlating their induced electron redistribution with ORR activity, which ultimately accelerates the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates for robust catalytic performance. Due to the improvement of graphitization degree, carbon supports possess efficient active sites and exhibit superior anti-corrosion. The resultant FeNC-2 M demonstrates outstanding ORR activity with high power density, maintaining remarkable durability in Zn-air batteries and microbial fuel cells.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests reveal that the Cu atoms of Cu-S1O2 SA/CPS are predominantly coordinated in a trinary manner (Cu-S1O2). Based on high-resolution aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM), it is demonstrated that the Cu single-atom sites are highly dispersed in Cu-S1O2 SA/CPS. It is evident from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that Cu-S1O2 SA/CPS has a two-dimensional layered structure. The specific structure of the active site Cu is primarily attributed to the coordination of S and O atoms, resulting in its superior stability for acetylene hydration towards the synthesis of acetaldehyde. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the formation of the Cu-S1O2 site facilitates the activation of acetylene, which is a pivotal step in the acetylene hydration process and considered as the rate-determining step. This article not only introduces an innovative strategy in the synthesis of Cu SACs but also represents a significant breakthrough in the stability of Cu SACs in acetylene hydration.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Exploring highly selective and stable electrocatalysts is of great significance for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into fuel. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure catalyst was developed by doping Pb single-atom (PbSA) in-situ on carbon paper (PbSA100-Cu/CP) through a low-energy and economical method. The designed catalyst exhibited abundant active sites and was beneficial to CO2 adsorption, activation, and subsequent conversion to fuel. Interestingly, PbSA100-Cu/CP showed a prominent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97 % at –0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a high partial current density of 27.9 mA·cm−2 for formate. Also, the catalyst remained significantly stable for 60 h during the durability test. The reaction mechanism was investigated by density functional theory (DFT), demonstrating that the doping PbSA induced the electrons redistribution, promoted the formate generation, reduced the rate-determining step (RDS) energy barrier, and inhibited the hydrogen evolution reaction. The study aims to provide a new strategy for developing of single-atom catalysts with high selectivity and stability, which will help reduce environmental pressure and alleviate energy problems.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': \"The ubiquity of refractory organic matter in aquatic environments necessitates innovative removal strategies. Sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation has emerged as an attractive solution, offering high selectivity, enduring efficacy, and anti-interference ability. Among many technologies, sulfite activation, leveraging its cost-effectiveness and lower toxicity compared to conventional persulfates, stands out. Yet, the activation process often relies on transition metals, suffering from low atom utilization. Here we introduce a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) employing transition metals on g-C3N4 substrates, effectively activating sulfite for acetaminophen degradation. We highlight the superior performance of Fe/CN, which demonstrates a degradation rate constant significantly surpassing those of Ni/CN and Cu/CN. Our investigation into the electronic and spin polarization characteristics of these catalysts reveals their critical role in catalytic efficiency, with oxysulfur radical-mediated reactions predominating. Notably, under visible light, the catalytic activity is enhanced, attributed to an increased generation of oxysulfur radicals and a strengthened electron donation-back donation dynamic. The proximity of Fe/CN's d-band center to the Fermi level, alongside its high spin polarization, is shown to improve sulfite adsorption and reduce the HOMO-LUMO gap, thereby accelerating photo-assisted sulfite activation. This work advances the understanding of SACs in environmental applications and lays the groundwork for future water treatment technologies.\",\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The sluggish reaction kinetics of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is one of the key challenges for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). To achieve robust alkaline HOR with minimized cost, we developed a single atom-cluster multiscale structure with isolated Pt single atoms anchored on Ru nanoclusters supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Pt1-Ru/NC). The well-defined structure not only provides multiple sites with varied affinity with the intermediates but also enables simultaneous modulation of different sites via interfacial interaction. In addition to weakening Ru–H bond strength, the isolated Pt sites are heavily involved in hydrogen adsorption and synergistically accelerate the Volmer step with the help of Ru sites. Furthermore, this catalyst configuration inhibits the excessive occupancy of oxygen-containing species on Ru sites and facilitates the HOR at elevated potentials. The Pt1-Ru/NC catalyst exhibits superior alkaline HOR performance with extremely high activity and excellent CO-tolerance. An AEMFC with a 0.1 mg·cmPGM−2 loading of Pt1-Ru/NC anode catalyst achieves a peak powder density of 1172 mW·cm−2, which is 2.17 and 1.55 times higher than that of Pt/C and PtRu/C, respectively.

The crystal form of carrier and the dispersion degree of active species have great influence on propane combustion catalysts, but its internal mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the amorphous atomic-layer Pt clusters (AL) and Pt single atoms (SA) on TiO2 with various crystal phases were prepared and used as propane combustion catalysts, where the as-synthesized Pt/a-TiO2 catalyst with atomic-layer Pt clusters exhibited better catalytic performance. The Pt/a-TiO2-AL could achieve a 90 % propane conversion (T90) at 230 °C, with the highest reaction rate (39.57 × 10−7 mol g−1 s−1) and TOF value (7.72 × 10−2 s−1) at 240 °C. Kinetic studies showed that oxygen had a lower inhibitory effect on Pt/a-TiO2-AL compared to that on the Pt/p-TiO2-AL and Pt/r-TiO2-AL catalysts; simultaneously, the Pt/a-TiO2-AL catalyst presented lower apparent activation energy compared with Pt/a-TiO2-SA. DFT results showed that atomic-layer Pt clusters on TiO2 had the lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy than Pt single atoms due to the synergistic effect between adjacent exposed Pt atoms in the fully exposed atomic-layer Pt clusters, which had a higher activation capacity for oxygen and thus accelerated propane combustion through the ignition effect (rapid activation of oxygen and rapid combustion of propane). Our primary results provide a promising approach for the creation of high-efficiency Pt-based catalysts, specifically tailored for the catalytic combustion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).',\n",

In comparison, the PtFeSn/x-Al2O3 (x = α, δ, γ) samples exhibit faster deactivation. Based on the systematic characterization of the materials, the phase transformation is observed to affect the surface acid properties and PtFeSn-support interactions, which exert great influence on the activity and coking behavior of catalysts. Moreover, the experiments and theoretical calculations for mechanism analysis illuminate that there is a strong correlation between the catalytic activity of PtFeSn/x-Al2O3 (x = α, δ, γ) samples in the PDH process and electron depletion of Pt species, which is influenced by the PtFeSn-supports interaction. Additionally, appropriate surface acidities and higher B/L ratio which is influenced by both supports and PtFeSn clusters, can enhance the initial catalytic activity and inhibit the generation of carbon deposited by inhibiting deep dehydrogenation of propylene.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysis to carbon monoxide (CO) is a very promising strategy for economically converting CO2, with high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) being regarded as the most suitable technology due to their high electrode reaction kinetics and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, while their practical application is highly dependent on the performance of their fuel electrode (cathode), which significantly determines the cell activity, selectivity, and durability. In this review, we provide a timely overview of the recent progress in the understanding and development of fuel electrodes, predominantly based on perovskite oxides, for CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO (CO2RR) in SOECs. Initially, the current understanding of the reaction mechanisms over the perovskite electrocatalyst for CO synthesis from CO2 electrolysis in SOECs is provided. Subsequently, the recent experimental advances in fuel electrodes are summarized, with importance placed on perovskite oxides and their modification, including bulk doping with multiple elements to introduce high entropy effects, various methods for realizing surface nanoparticles or even single atom catalyst modification, and nanocompositing. Additionally, the recent progress in numerical modeling-assisted fast screening of perovskite electrocatalysts for high-temperature CO2RR is summarized, and the advanced characterization techniques for an in-depth understanding of the related fundamentals for the CO2RR over perovskite oxides are also reviewed. The recent pro-industrial application trials of the CO2RR in SOECs are also briefly discussed. Finally, the future prospects and challenges of SOEC cathodes for the CO2RR are suggested.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Pyrolyzed iron and nitrogen codoped carbon materials (Fe-N-C) with atomically dispersed Fe-Nx sites have received extensive attention as a highly promising alternative to Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet there remains a considerable performance gap between them. To further improve the catalytic performance of Fe-N-C catalysts, we herein developed a microwave-assisted method to improve both the active site density (SD) and intrinsic activity, thus achieving outstanding ORR activity. The in situ generated Fe precipitation is beneficial to improve the doping efficiency of Fe and the subsequent formation of synergetic active sites, leading to increased SD. Both the X-ray absorption spectroscopy and operando Raman confirmed the copresence of atomic Fe moieties and nanoclusters, in which the nanoclusters synergically promote the activity of the single atomic sites. The enriched synergetic active sites endow the as-prepared catalyst with excellent performance by showing a current density of 42 mA cm-2 at 0.9 V in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, approaching the DOE 2025 target. This work not only affords a highly active ORR catalyst but also provides a simple and potentially scale-up approach to Fe-N-C catalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': \"Ammonia production seeks alternatives to the conventional Haber-Bosch process, with nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) emerging promising. Addressing the challenge of efficient catalysts, the functionalized graphene-based single atom catalysts (SACs) stand out. While prior studies have favored heteroatom-doped catalysts, the coordination of metal centers with nitrogen atoms remains underexplored. This work investigates transition metal (TM) SACs on nitrogen-doped graphene (N3G) using density functional theory (DFT) for electro-catalytic NRR. Results highlight the stability of V@N3G, Mo@N3G, W@N3G, with binding energies of −7.77, −5.43, and −3.89 eV, respectively. Insights into work function, d-band center, N–N bond, and IR stretching's role in N2 activation are gained through this study. Bader charge analysis reveals electron redistribution between the support and adsorbed N2. Employing Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) method, comparative free energy diagrams for TM@N3G (V, Mo, W) via., enzymatic, consecutive, alternating, and distal pathways outline potential rate determining step (PDS) with and without the Implicit solvation method. Remarkably, W@N3G catalyst exhibits the lowest PDS in the presence of solvation energy, surpassing other catalysts. The multi-adsorption of N2 on W@N3G enhances NRR process, stabilizing intermediates for efficient ammonia production. This computational study sheds light on metal center SACs on functionalized graphene support as a potential electro-catalyst for efficient and stable NRR.\",\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'High-energy-density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are limited by reaction or diffusion barriers with dissatisfactory electrochemical kinetics. Typical conversion-type lithium sulfur battery systems exemplify the kinetic challenges. Namely, before diffusing or reacting in the electrode surface/interior, the Li(solvent)x+ dissociation at the interface to produce isolated Li+, is usually a prerequisite fundamental step either for successive Li+ “reduction” or for Li+ to participate in the sulfur conversions, contributing to the related electrochemical barriers. Thanks to the ideal atomic efficiency (100 at%), single atom catalysts (SACs) have gained attention for use in LMBs toward resolving the issues caused by the five types of barrier-restricted processes, including polysulfide/Li2S conversions, Li(solvent)x+ desolvation, and Li0 nucleation/diffusion. In this perspective, the tandem reactions including desolvation and reaction or plating and corresponding catalysis behaviors are introduced and analyzed from interface to electrode interior. Meanwhile, the principal mechanisms of highly efficient SACs in overcoming specific energy barriers to reinforce the catalytic electrochemistry are discussed. Lastly, the future development of high-efficiency atomic-level catalysts in batteries is presented.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'In the quest to boost the intrinsic activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs), optimizing the electronic properties of metal centers and maximizing active sites play a pivotal role. Here, a facile surface molten salt-assisted approach for fabricating porous iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts enriched with catalytically accessible single-atom motifs is reported. Multiple characterization analyses prove that abundant intrinsic defects are generated at the edge sites, resulting in the formation of thermally stable unstitched Fe-N3 motif. Theoretical investigations unveil that the transition from Fe-N4 to Fe-N3 induces structural alteration, resulting in the convergence of Fe-3d orbital energy to Fermi energy. The low-coordinated Fe-N3 motif exhibits higher activation ability, reinforcing its interaction with O3 and weakening the O-O bond. This leads to a reduction in the reactivity of surface atomic oxygen barriers (O3-to-*O/*OO), ultimately achieving efficient catalytic oxidation of methyl mercaptan and its intermediates, achieving performance 20-fold higher than intact Fe-N4 catalysts and 625-fold higher than commercial MnO2.

Herein, an effective strategy is developed by introducing an axial hydroxyl (OH) group to the Fe─N4 center, simultaneously assisting with the further construction of asymmetric configurations by replacing one N atom with one S atom, forming FeN3S1─OH configuration. This novel structure can optimize the electronic structure and d-band center shift to reduce the reaction energy barrier, thereby promoting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities.

However, the AEMWEs with alkaline electrolytes suffer from poor performance at high current density compared to proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Here, atomically dispersed Pt-Ru dual sites co-embedded in nanoporous nickel selenides (np/Pt1Ru1-Ni0.85Se) are developed by a rapid melt-quenching approach to achieve highly-efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The np/Pt1Ru1-Ni0.85Se catalyst shows ampere-level current density with a low overpotential (46 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 225 mV at 1000 mA cm−2), low Tafel slope (32.4 mV dec−1), and excellent long-term durability, significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst and other advanced large-current catalysts. The remarkable HER performance of nanoporous Pt1Ru1-Ni0.85Se is attributed to the strong intracrystal electronic metal-support interaction (IEMSI) between Pt-Se-Ru sites and Ni0.85Se support which can greatly enlarge the charge redistribution density, reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation, and optimize the potential determining step. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline AEMWE with an ultralow Pt and Ru loading realizes an industrial-level current density of 1 A cm−2 at 1.84 volts with high durability.',\n",

However, the inefficient redox kinetics and “shuttling effect” of iodine species result in unsatisfactory energy efficiency and short cycle life, hindering their commercialization. In this work, Ni single atoms highly dispersed on carbon fibers is designed and synthesized as iodine anchoring sites and dual catalysts for Zn-I2 batteries, and successfully inhibit the iodine species shuttling and boost dual reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculations indicate that the reinforced d-p orbital hybridization and charge interaction between Ni single-atoms and iodine species effectively enhance the confinement of iodine species. Ni single-atoms also accelerate the iodine conversion reactions with tailored bonding structure of I─I bonds and reduced energy barrier for the dual conversion of iodine species. Consequently, the high-rate performance (180 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1), cycling stability (capacity retention of 74% after 5900 cycles) and high energy efficiency (90% at 3 A g−1) are achieved.

This study reports a controllable engineering approach to tailor the structure of nickel-layered double hydroxides via doped and absorbed platinum single atoms (PtSA) promoted by low electronegative transition metal (Mn, Fe) moieties (PtSA-Mn,Fe-Ni LDHs). We explore that the electron donation from neighboring transition metal moieties results in the well-adjusted d-band center with the low valence states of PtSA(doped) and PtSA(ads.), thus optimizing adsorption energy to effectively accelerate the H2 release. Meanwhile, a tailored local chemical environment on transition metal centers with unique charge redistribution and high valence states functions as the main center for H2O catalytic dissociation into oxygen. Therefore, the PtSA-Mn,Fe-Ni LDH material possesses a small overpotential of 42 and 288 mV to reach 10 mA·cm-2 for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, superior to most reported LDH-based catalysts. Additionally, the mass activity of PtSA-Mn,Fe-Ni LDHs proves to be 15.45 times higher than that of commercial Pt-C. The anion exchange membrane electrolyzer stack of PtSA-Mn,Fe-Ni LDHs(+,−) delivers a cell voltage of 1.79 V at 0.5 A·cm-2 and excellent durability over 600 h.

Tailoring the electronic structure of conductive PCPs/MOFs is crucial for achieving specific applications, but it remains challenging. Herein, we introduce a novel approach called the “single-atom” strategy to tailor the electronic structure of conductive PCPs/MOFs to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia. By incorporating atomically dispersed Ru3+ (at a content of about 5% per Co) into semiconducting PCPs, we successfully created a highly efficient PCP-based electrocatalyst named Ru-Co-pyNDI, which exhibits good structural stability and improved electrocatalytic performance. The calculated and experimental results reveal that doping atomically dispersed Ru3+ into Co-pyNDI induces local structural distortion, resulting in a downshift of the d-band center of the Co, which in turn facilitates the desorption of intermediates. As a result, the Ru-Co-pyNDI catalyst demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance in NH3 production compared to other heterogeneous catalysts, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency of about 97% and an ammonia yield rate of 12010 μg h-1 mgcat.-1 (0.28 mmol h-1 cm-2) under neutral aqueous conditions.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Precise tuning of the coordination microenvironment is essential to enhance the intrinsic catalytic performance and reaction kinetics of metal single-atom catalysts (SACs). This study proposes a novel strategy to optimize the electronic properties of zinc (Zn) SACs by manipulating the s-band center of the Zn atom within the zinc-nitrogen moieties (Zn-Nx, x = 2, 3, and 4) through adjusting the number of coordination atoms (N) and introducing heteroatoms (P, B, and S) with varying electronegativity. The results demonstrate that the Zn-N2P site, characterized by optimal electron density, exhibits superior performance (conversion ≥ 99.9%, chemoselectivity = 100%), and accelerated reaction kinetics (Ea as low as 94.7 kJ mol−1) in the intramolecular hydroamination of 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline, surpassing state-of-the-art transition metal catalysts. In contrast, both experimental and theoretical results indicate that Zn-N2B and Zn-N2S catalysts exhibit significantly lower activities than Zn-N2P and Zn-N3. The superior performance of Zn-N2P originates from an electronic effect, where the electron-donating P heteroatom redistributes the electron cloud, adjusts the polarization of the Zn-N2P moiety, and thereby markedly enhances the adsorption and activation capabilities of 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline.

Nobel metals are known for their activity towards this chemoselective transformation, however, sustainable catalyst synthesis requires optimal utilisation of these scarce elements. Here, we report Au catalytic systems based on the deposition of isolated Au sites on different morphologies of ceria in which different surface facets of the support are exposed. Through tailoring the support morphology and from extensive catalyst characterisation, it is shown that the exposed facet is critical for controlling the formation (or not) of isolated Au sites. Both the 110 and 111 facets are capable of this feat, yielding single-atom sites for rod, octahedron, and polyhedron morphologies. In contrast, the 100 facet is not, resulting in Au nanoparticles on cubic ceria. This dictation over Au species is critical to benzyl alcohol oxidation capacity at mild conditions and in the absence of a soluble base, with only single-atom catalyst (SAC) systems demonstrating activity. Furthermore, the exposed surface facet also governs the degree of surface oxygen vacancies, which is critical to catalyst activity due to their control over substrate adsorption strength, as revealed through T1/T2 NMR relaxation measurements.',\n",

Coadsorption of carbonyl and carbonate moieties on the same platinum atom is found likely, based on both experimental and thermodynamic arguments.

However, poor stability is a roadblock to their practical applications. Recent studies suggested that introducing electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents near their catalytic active sites may improve their stability. However, standard M-N-C catalysts synthesized by high-temperature pyrolysis have inhomogeneous structures, making it challenging to understand their degradation mechanisms. Here, we use a series of heterogeneous molecular catalysts with well-defined structures as model Fe-N-C catalysts to map their degradation for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic electrolytes, relevant to M-N-C catalysts’ applications in proton-exchange hydrogen fuel cells. Iron phthalocyanine molecules with different types of electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents (i.e., -H, -tBu, -NH2 at α-position, or β-position, -NO2, and -F) are adsorbed on purified carbon nanotubes and exhibit varied oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in acidic electrolytes. Detailed characterizations identify five degradation paths and reveal the beneficial role of electron-withdrawing substituents, i.e., -F and -NO2, by quantifying the Fe distribution. We find that direct Fe leaching from Fe-N4 sites plays a crucial role in early-stage degradation, and it can be significantly suppressed by -F and -NO2 substituents. The oxidative degradation becomes dominant with time, forming FeOx nanoclusters on a carbon nanotube substrate, which the electron-withdrawing substituents can partially alleviate.

The DMFC produces current and power densities of 657 mA cm-2 and 97.4 mW cm-2, respectively, at a potential of 0.65 V with a 98.4% Faraday efficiency for formate at 80 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that CH3OH molecules preferentially adsorb onto the PtRu single atoms, but their oxidation to CO2 molecules on PtRuSA/NPC is kinetically unfavorable due to the large energy barrier.

All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M−N3 sites promoted the self-decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d-band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co-PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100 % selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.',\n",

This study addresses the stability and reactivity of Pt SAs on TiO2 surfaces by investigating various post-deposition annealing treatments in air, Ar, and Ar-H2 environments at different temperatures.

Sono-immunotherapy is a new treatment modality that can reverse immunosuppressive TME, but the sonodynamic effects are compromised by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in the TME. Herein, this work reports a new sono-immunotherapy strategy using Pdδ+ single atom catalysts to enhance positive sonodynamic responses to the immunosuppressive and sono-suppressive TME. To demonstrate this technique, this work employs rich and reductive Ti vacancies in Ti3-xC2Ty nanosheets to construct the atomically dispersed Pd-C3 single atom catalysts (SAC) with Pd content up to 2.5 wt% (PdSA/Ti3-xC2Ty). Compared with Pd nanoparticle loaded Ti3-xC2Ty, PdSA/Ti3-xC2Ty single-atom enzyme showed augmented sonodynamic effects that are ascribed to SAC facilitated electron–hole separation, rapid depletion of overexpressed GSH by ultrasound (US) excited holes, and catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 for relieving hypoxia. Importantly, the sono-immunotherapy strategy can boost abscopal antitumor immune responses by driving maturation of dendritic cells and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages into the antitumoral M1 phenotype.

Essentially, single Fe sites serve as electron acceptors and effectively promote photo-induced electron transfer from Ce to Fe via the formed Ce-O-Fe bond, while Ov-induced Ce3+ sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of H2O2 to produce ˙OH, which further activates CH4 and generates various products.

The heterogeneous catalyst was composed of holey graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets carrying highly dispersed single atoms (Mn, Ni, or Cu). Mechanistic studies revealed that the strong interaction between single metal sites and H2O2 forms two adsorption configurations (HOO- and H(O-O)-), which trigger the generation of different reactive oxygen species (ROS). The heterogeneous Mn-C3N4 catalyst provided single Mn-N3 sites that activated H2O2 to produce O2 by forming HOO-Mn-N3, while the adjacent Fe2+ quickly reduced the generated O2 to ˙O2−, which can efficiently remove organic pollutants and inactivate Escherichia coli under neutral conditions. The single-atom Mn-C3N4, in addition, provided photoactive electrons that drive the efficient cycling of the homogeneous Fe2+/Fe3+ catalyst (which is the rate-determining step) under very trace Fe2+ input.

It is worth noting that as the diameter of Ru-DVBNNT(n, n) continues to increase, their stability and activity also continue to enhance, and Ru-DVBNNT(8, 8) with the largest diameter is expected to become the best performing CO2RR electrocatalyst with the UL value of −0.16 V. Besides, for Ru-DVBNNT(3, 3) and Ru-DVBNNT(4, 4), their final product is HCOOH. In contrast, the CH4 product is more inclined to form on Ru-DVBNNTs with chiral indexes of (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), and (8, 8).

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'As cost-effective catalysts, platinum (Pt) single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted substantial attention. However, most studies indicate that Pt SACs in acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) follow the slow Volmer-Heyrovsky (VH) mechanism instead of the fast kinetic Volmer-Tafel (VT) pathway. Here, this work propose that the VH mechanism in Pt SACs can be switched to the faster VT pathway for efficient HER by correlating Pt single atoms (SAs) with Pt clusters (Cs). Our calculations reveal that the correlation between Pt SAs and Cs significantly impacts the electronic structure of exposed Pt atoms, lowering the adsorption barrier for atomic hydrogen and enabling a faster VT mechanism. To validate these findings, this work purposely synthesize three catalysts: l-Pt@MoS2, m-Pt@MoS2 and h-Pt@MoS2 with low, moderate, and high Pt-loading, having different distributions of Pt SAs and Cs. The m-Pt@MoS2 catalyst with properly correlating Pt SAs and Cs exhibits outstanding performance with an overpotential of 47 mV and Tafel slope of 32 mV dec−1. Further analysis of the Tafel values confirms that the m-Pt@MoS2 sample indeed follows the VT reaction mechanism, aligning with the theoretical findings. This study offers a deep understanding of the synergistic mechanism, paving a way for designing novel-advanced catalysts.',\n",

However, their performance still has a large gap considering the demand for their practical applications. This study reports a high-performance dual single-atom doped carbon catalyst (HfCo–N–C), which is prepared by pyrolyzing Co and Hf co-doped ZIF-8. Co and Hf are atomically dispersed in the carbon framework and coordinated with N to form Co–N4 and Hf–N4 active moieties. The synergetic effect between Co–N4 and Hf–N4 significantly enhance the catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst. In an acidic medium, the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) of the catalyst is up to 0.82 V, which is much higher than that of the Co–N–C catalyst without Hf co-doping (0.80 V). The kinetic current density of the catalyst is up to 2.49 A cm−2 at 0.85 V, which is 1.74 times that of the Co–N–C catalyst without Hf co-doping. Moreover, the catalyst exhibits excellent cathodic performance in single proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn–air batteries. Furthermore, Hf co-doping can effectively suppress the formation of H2O2, resulting in significantly improved stability and durability.',\n",

The well-defined structure of ZnMo6 led to precise local Zn sublimation during the formation of Mo2C, which was converted from the Mo6 ring in situ. The localized defect provides a well-defined Mo(C)-Pt-N coordination environment to trap Pt single-atoms.

To enhance durability, we discuss methods to stabilize metal centers, mitigate the effects of the Fenton reaction, and improve graphitization of the carbon matrix. Future research should apply computational chemistry to predict catalyst properties, develop in situ characterization for real-time active site analysis, explore novel catalysts without the use of platinum-based catalysts to reduce dependence on rare and noble metal, and investigate the long-term stability of catalyst under operating conditions.

Herein, we propose a heterogeneous interface reverse atom capture strategy to construct Ru with unique asymmetric Ru1N2O1 coordination. Ru1N2O1/CeO2 exhibits intrinsic low-temperature conversion (T100 at 160 °C) compared to symmetric coordinated Ru-based (280 °C), Ir-based (220 °C), and Pt-based (200 °C) catalysts, and the TOF is 65.4 times that of Ag-based catalysts. The experimental and theoretical studies show that there is a strong d-p orbital interaction between Ru and N atoms, which not only enhances the adsorption of ammonia at the Ru1N2O1 position but also optimizes the electronic configuration of Ru. Furthermore, the affinity of Ru1N2O1/CeO2 to water is significantly weaker than that of conventional catalysts (the binding energy of the Pd3Au1 catalyst is −1.19 eV, but it is −0.39 eV for our material), so it has excellent water resistance. Finally, the N(sp3)-H activation of NH3 requires the assistance of surface reactive oxygen species, but we found that asymmetric Ru1N2O1 can directly activate the N(sp3)-H bond without the involvement of surface reactive oxygen species.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Nanoparticle (NP) size and proximity are two physical descriptors applicable to practically all NP-supported catalysts. However, with conventional catalyst design, independent variation of these descriptors to investigate their individual effects on thermocatalysis remains challenging. Using a raspberry-colloid-templating approach, we synthesized a well-defined catalyst series comprising Pd12Au88 alloy NPs of three distinct sizes and at two different interparticle distances. We show that NP size and interparticle distance independently control activity and selectivity, respectively, in the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol and toluene. Surface-sensitive spectroscopic analysis indicates that the surfaces of smaller NPs expose a greater fraction of reactive Pd dimers, compared to inactive Pd single atoms, thereby increasing intrinsic catalytic activity. Computational simulations reveal how a larger interparticle distance improves catalytic selectivity by diminishing the local benzyl alcohol concentration profile between NPs, thus suppressing its readsorption and consequently, undesired formation of toluene. Accordingly, benzyl alcohol yield is maximized using catalysts with smaller NPs separated by larger interparticle distances, overcoming activity-selectivity trade-offs. This work exemplifies the high suitability of the modular raspberry-colloid-templating method as a model catalyst platform to isolate individual descriptors and establish clear structure-property relationships, thereby bridging the materials gap between surface science and technical catalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Conspectus Buckminsterfullerene, C60, was discovered through a prominent mass peak containing 60 atoms produced from laser vaporization of graphite, driven by Kroto’s interest in understanding the formation mechanisms of carbon-containing molecules in space. Inspired by the geodesic dome-shaped architecture designed by Richard Buckminster Fuller, after whom the particle was named, C60 was found to have a football-shaped structure comprising 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It sparked worldwide interest in understanding this new carbon allotrope, resulting in the awarding of the Noble Prize in Chemistry to Smalley, Kroto, and Curl in 1996. Intrinsically, C60 is an exceptional species because of its high stability and electron-accepting ability and its structural tunability by decorating or substituting either on its exterior surface or interior hollow cavity. For example, metal-decorated fullerene complexes have found important applications ranging from superconductivity, nanoscale electronic devices, and organic photovoltaic cells to catalysis and biomedicine. Compared to the large body of studies on atoms and molecules encapsulated by C60, studies on the exteriorly modified fullerenes, i.e., exohedral fullerenes, are scarcer. Surprisingly, to date, uncertainty exists about a fundamental question: what is the preferable exterior binding site of different kinds of single atoms on the C60 surface? In recent years, we have developed an experimental protocol to synthesize the desired fullerene-metal clusters and to record their infrared spectra via messenger-tagged infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy. With complementary quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, we determined that the most probable binding site of a metal, specifically a vanadium cation, on C60 is above a pentagonal center in an η5 fashion. We explored the bonding nature between C60 and V+ and revealed that the high thermal stability of this cluster originates from large orbital and electrostatic interactions. Through comparing the measured infrared spectra of [C60-Metal]+ with the observational Spitzer data of several fullerene-rich planetary nebulae, we proposed that the complexes formed by fullerene and cosmically abundant metals, for example, iron, are promising carriers of astronomical unidentified spectroscopic features. This opens the door for a real consideration of Kroto’s 30-year-old hypothesis that complexes involving cosmically abundant elements and C60 exhibit strong charge-transfer bands, similar to those of certain unidentified astrophysical spectroscopic features. We compiled a VibFullerene database and extracted a set of vibrational frequencies and intensities for fullerene derivatives to facilitate their potential detection by the James Webb Space Telescope. In addition, we showed that upon infrared irradiation C60V+ can efficiently catalyze water splitting to generate H2. This finding is attributed to the novel geometric-electronic effects of C60, acting as “hydrogen shuttle” and “electron sponge”, which illustrates the important role of carbon-based supports in single-atom catalysts. Our work not only unveils the basic structures and bonding nature of fullerene-metal clusters but also elucidates their potential importance in astrophysics, astrochemistry, and catalysis, showing the multifaceted character of this class of clusters. More exciting and interesting aspects of the fullerene-metal clusters, such as ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics between fullerene and metal and their relevance to designing hybrid fullerene-metal junctions for electronic devices, are awaiting exploration.',\n",

The rational design and incorporation of SMACs into diverse support materials, including carbon materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials and metal oxides, is critical to increasing their active-site density. This enhancement is essential for maximizing the effectiveness and selectivity of SMACs. However, there are challenges in the preparation of single-atom metal catalysts because each active metal site exhibits a tremendous amount of free energy, leading to agglomeration. This review paper discusses the importance of defects in introducing a micro-coordination environment in a wide range of materials in order to enhance the stabilization of SMACs. The introduction of defects in the preparation of SMACs has validated its success as a successful scientific approach in the enhancement of the uniform dispersion of SMACs. In this paper, we have investigated the role of several kinds of defects, such as vacancies, heteroatom doping, and intrinsic defects, on porous carbon, graphene, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) and metal oxide substrates to accommodate and achieve optimal loading of SMACs. To provide a fresh perspective, we emphasize several non-conventional schemes regarding defect-inducing techniques, such as the electrochemical method, plasma method, ion-radiation method, and etch evaporation process. Furthermore, the mechanism of defect engineering is explored in detail by analyzing the electronic structure as well as the Fermi level of metal atoms by advanced characterization. This review addresses the future challenges in the field of SMACs and summarizes the meaningful findings on the role of defects on supports in stabilizing SMACs.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) play a crucial role in mitigating the shuttling of Na-pS/Ses and in promoting Na2S/Se redox processes at the cathode. In this work, single transition metal atoms Co, Fe, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Rh supported in nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (rg-C3N4) are investigated to explore the charging and discharging kinetics of Na-S and Na-Se batteries using Density Functional Theory calculations. We find that SAs adsorbed on reduced g-C3N4 monolayers are substantially more effective in trapping higher-order Na2Xn than pristine g-C3N4 surfaces. Moreover, our ab initio molecular dynamics calculations indicate that the structure of X8 (X = S, Se) remains almost intact when adsorbed on Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pt, and Rh SACs, suggesting that there is no significant S or Se poisoning in these cases. Additionally, SACs reduce the free energies of the rate-determining step during discharge and present a lower decomposition barrier of Na2X during charging of Na-X electrode. The underlying mechanisms behind this fast kinetics are thoroughly examined using charge transfer, bonding strength, and d-band center analysis.

       "  'ABSTRACT': \"Descriptors are properties or parameters of a material that are used to explain any catalytic activity both computationally and experimentally. Such descriptors aid in designing the material's properties to obtain an efficient catalyst. For transition metals, the d-band center is a well-known descriptor that shows a Sabatier type relationship for several catalytic reactions. However, it fails to explain the activity when considering the same metal active site with a varying local environment. To address this, density functional theory was used for single atom catalysts (SACs) embedded on armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons (AGNR and ZGNR). By varying the anchoring nitrogen atoms' orientation and considering pristine and doped cases, 432 active sites were used to test the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. It was observed that S and SO2 dopants help in reducing the overpotential on Co-SAC (η = 0.28 V). Along with the d-band center, a total of 105 possible descriptors were individually tested and failed to correlate with the OER activity. Furthermore, PCA was employed to narrow down unique descriptors, and machine learning algorithms (MLR, RR, SVR, RFR, BRR, LASSO, KNN and XGR) were trained on the two obtained descriptors. Among the models, SVR and RFR models showed the highest performances with R2 = 0.89 and 0.88 on test data. This work shows the necessity for a multi-descriptor approach to explain OER catalytic activity on SACs and the approach would help in identifying similar descriptors for other catalytic reactions as well.\",\n",

However, despite its advantages, the intrinsic properties of MoTe2, like the low chemical activity of its basal plane, also resulted in several technological challenges. To overcome these limitations, several methods have been explored, with single atom doping emerging as a particularly promising approach. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the influence of single atom impurities on the chemical activity of MoTe2. A total of 22 dopants were selected from the p-block of the periodic table, ranging from boron to bismuth. Specifically, we examined the adsorption of oxygen molecules (O2) on the doped structures to assess their impact on layer chemical activity. Our findings revealed that doping was energetically favorable for all investigated atoms, and it had a significant effect on surface activity. Notably, doping with dopants from groups 13–15, especially those with low atomic number, results in significant increased adsorption strength, leading to weakening of the molecular bonding in O2 by up 5.72 eV, hinting at the potential use as catalyst. Additionally, we identified certain molecules, primarily from group 17, with a remarkably high adsorption energy to charge transfer ratio. This leads to excellent sensing characteristics, where the response to adsorption in their carrier concentration is increased 100-fold over the pristine MoTe2, while sensor recovery is estimated between 0.01 and 2 s.',\n",

In this study, Cu single-atom and NiCu dual-atom catalysts supported on different graphene variants were effectively developed as electrocatalysts for the production of clean oxygen. Various techniques, including XRD, SEM, Raman, HR-TEM, EXAFS and XPS, were used to characterize these synthesized electrocatalysts. The extent of reduction in graphene oxide (GO) support was confirmed using Raman analysis which demonstrated a greater ID/IG-apparent intensity ratio, indicating that the GO (ID/IG=0.9) has more sp3-hybridized carbon with respect to the rGO (ID/IG= 0.6). The HR-TEM analysis with EDX and STEM data confirmed the dispersion of Cu and NiCu dimer over the surface of graphene variants. XPS and EXAFS studies revealed predominant metallic nature of Cu and NiCu dimer with the synergistic interplay between the constituent atoms. Copper-nickel dimer catalyst supported on reduced graphene oxide (CuNi/rGO) demonstrated the best electrocatalytic performance, where a lower overpotential of 320 mV was observed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with lowest Tafel slope of 110 mV/dec for oxygen evolution reaction. Good stability was observed after 1000 CV cycles and 50 h of electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH electrolytic solution at an oxidation potential of 1.62 V (vs RHE). Control experiments were also performed using borosilicate pyrex glass and Teflon made electrochemical cells in order to over rule the probable involvement of leached out impurities in OER reaction under extreme alkaline conditions. The calculations obtained from Density Functional Theory (DFT) suggest that the dual-atom catalysts have lower overpotential (0.33 V at Cu-site) with respect to the single-atom catalysts, which agreed well with the experimental results. Also, the Cu-site OER was found to have lower overpotential (0.33 V) than the Ni-site (0.47 V).

Al2O3 stabilized Ni atoms via Ni-O4 coordination are well illustrated by combined characterizations. For propane dehydrogenation, reactivity measurements show that the center of Ni-O ion pairs effectively activates C3H8 and the higher rate of C3H6 formation on Ni SAs than Ni NPs, by a factor of 12, is the result of inhibition of C-C bond cleavage involving side reactions, as identified by density functional calculations. Beyond that, this lattice-embedded Ni SAC exhibits superior stability and recyclability in long-term operation with little coke accumulation.',\n",

However, there are rare reports on the charge transfer process and its influence on local atomic configuration during the photocatalytic process. Herein, we for the first time observe the charge migration and bond evolution of a single-atom Pt/C3N5 catalysts during the water splitting process by combining synchronous-illumination X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SI-XPS) with synchronous-illumination diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SI-DRIFTS). The results clearly reveal that the dynamic evolution of N-Ptδ+ (0 <δ < 2) bond not only provides a real transport channel for the rapid transferring of photo-induced electrons but also suppresses the reverse reaction of forming water from H2 and O2. Based on the above unique structure characterizations, single-atom Pt/C3N5 catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity (18.2 mmol·g-1·h-1) under visible light in comparison with metallic Pt-C3N5 (3.6 mmol·g-1·h-1).',\n",

Among these, the single-atomic metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are emerging candidates due to their high activity and prolonged lifespan. However, traditional preparation of M-N-C catalysts suffers from thermal aggregation and low space-time yield, limiting their application in industry. Inspired by the “chainmail protection” in carbonaceous materials, here we propose an “armor protection” strategy for the large-scale synthesis of a highly active Fe single-atom ORR catalyst (Fe-8/8-CN) by pyrolyzing a well-designed precursor Fe-ZIF-8/ZIF-8. In this precursor, the 2-methylimidazole zinc MOF (ZIF-8) loaded with iron (Fe-ZIF-8) is encased in an additional ZIF-8 armor layer (Fe-ZIF-8/ZIF-8) that effectively shields the aggregation of Fe species within the inner ZIF-8 during the pyrolysis process, ultimately yielding the Fe single-atom ORR catalyst (Fe-8/8-CN). Furthermore, the facile approaches for the construction of Fe-ZIF-8/ZIF-8 make it efficiently scale up with a high space-time yield of 18.7 kg m-3 day-1. In particular, the armor protection strategy for preparing the Fe single-atom catalyst is universally applicable to leaf-shaped ZIF-L and other ZIFs with diverse morphologies. Thanks to the presence of the outer ZIF-8 layer and the inner ZIF-8 core to dispersing Fe single-atom catalytic sites with the porous and defect-rich characteristics from the volatilization of Zn in ZIF-8, the resulting Fe-8/8-CN demonstrates superior ORR performance in alkaline electrolyte (E1/2 = 0.93 V, JL = −5.89 mA cm-2).

However, the reported catalysts still face the challenges of undesirable conversion and CO2 selectivity at low temperatures, as well as deficient water resistance, which restrict industrial application. In recent years, single-atom catalysts have emerged as hot topics in the field of catalysis due to their exceptional properties, but the relatively high cost and complex preparation methods limit their large-scale application. Herein, α-MnO2 doped with single-atom Co was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. The catalyst with optimal loading (0.1 Co/MnO2-H) delivered outstanding performance for the oxidation of acetone, achieving 90% conversion of 100 ppm of acetone at 135 °C with 100% CO2 yield, far superior to those of Pt/TiO2- and MnO2-based catalysts. Stable single-atom cobalt on MnO2 with strong Mn-O-Co interaction, excellent oxygen activation property, low-temperature reducibility, abundant and stable Lewis acid sites, and easier CO2 desorption contributes to its outstanding acetone oxidation activity at low temperatures. Remarkably, the loading of monatomic Co greatly enhanced the water resistance of Mn-based catalysts. H2O-TPD and density functional theory calculations showed that 0.1 Co/MnO2-H facilitated water dissociation into hydroxyl groups, which could form a hydrogen-bonded complex with acetone, thus promoting acetone oxidation instead of poisoning. These findings identify a facile and promising approach for preparing stable and high-performance monatomic catalysts for acetone purification as well as other thermocatalytic oxidation reactions, especially with the coexistence of H2O impurity.',\n",

Owing to its rich active sites on the surface and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs), ACT-CoZrO2 gives superior performance in catalyzing the CO2-to-syngas conversion as demonstrated by experiments and theoretical calculations.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The present study proposes a novel engineering concept for the customization of functionality and construction of superstructure to fabricate 2D monolayered N-doped carbon superstructure electrocatalysts decorated with Co single atoms or Co2P nanoparticles derived from 2D bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF superstructure precursors. The hierarchically porous carbon superstructure maximizes the exposure of accessible active sites, enhances electron/mass transport efficiency, and accelerates reaction kinetics simultaneously. Consequently, the Co single atoms embedded N-doped carbon superstructure (Co-NCS) exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction, achieving a half-wave potential of 0.886 V versus RHE. Additionally, the Co2P nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon superstructure (Co2P-NCS) demonstrates high activity for both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, delivering low overpotentials of 292 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 193 mV at 10 mA cm−2 respectively. Impressively, when employed in an assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery, the as-prepared 2D carbon superstructure electrocatalysts exhibit exceptional performance with a peak power density of 219 mW cm−2 and a minimal charge/discharge voltage gap of only 1.16 V at 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the cell voltage required to drive an overall water-splitting electrolyzer at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is merely 1.69 V using these catalysts as electrodes.',\n",

To ameliorate the issue, the ionic liquids with different cations or anions are used in this work to regulate the micro-surface of nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ni and Fe dual-atom sites catalyst (NiFe-N-C) by an impregnation method. The experimental data reveals the dual function of ionic liquids, which enhances CO2 adsorption ability and modulates electronic structure, facilitating CO2 anion radical (CO2•¯) stabilization and decreasing onset potential. The theoretical calculation results prove that the attachment of ionic liquids modulates electronic structure, reduces energy barrier of CO2•¯ formation, and enhances overall ECR performance. Based on these merits, BMImPF6 modified NiFe-N-C (NiFe-N-C/BMImPF6) achieves the high CO faradaic efficiency of 91.9% with a CO partial current density of −120 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V. When the NiFe-N-C/BMImPF6 is assembled as cathode of Zn-CO2 battery, it delivers the highest power density of 2.61 mW cm−2 at 2.57 mA cm−2 and superior cycling stability.

Herein, the main-group metal indium (In) single atom is immobilized on sulfur-doped porous carbon nitride nanosheets (In@CNS) in the form of three nitrogen atoms coordinated with one sulfur atom (In–N3−S). Both theoretical calculations and advanced characterization investigations clearly elucidated that the single-atomic In–N3–S structures on In@CNS are powerful in promoting the dissociation of excitons into more free carriers as well as the charge separation, synergistically elevating electron concentration by 2.19 times with respect to pristine CNS.

Although dissolved O2 (DO) has recently been considered superior to H2O2 as a coreactant in the most widely used luminol ECL systems owing to its improved stability and less biotoxicity, it still has unsatisfactory ECL performance because of its ultralow reactivity.

Under optimal conditions, the performance of the resulting ECL system could be markedly increased up to 1300-fold compared to the traditional luminol-DO system. Further investigations revealed that duple binding sites of pFe-g-CN and plasmonically induced hot holes that disseminated from AgNPs to g-CN surfaces lead to facilitate significantly the luminous reaction process of the system.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The urgent environmental concern of methane abatement, attributed to its high global warming potential, necessitates the development of methane oxidation catalysts (MOC) with enhanced low-temperature activity and durability. Herein, an iridium-doped PdOx nanoparticle supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (PdIr/S-1) catalyst was synthesized and applied for methane catalytic combustion. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed the atomically dispersed nature of iridium on the surface of PdOx nanoparticles, creating an Ir4f-O-Pdcus microstructure. The atomically doped Ir transferred more electrons to adjacent oxygen atoms, modifying the electronic structure of PdOx and thus enhancing the redox ability of the PdIr/S-1 catalysts. This electronic modulation facilitated methane adsorption on the Pd site of Ir4f-O-Pdcus, reducing the energy barrier for C-H bond cleavage and thereby increasing the reaction rate for methane oxidation. Consequently, the optimized PdIr0.1/S-1 showed outstanding low-temperature activity for methane combustion (T50 = 276 °C) after aging and maintained long-term stability over 100 h under simulated exhaust conditions. Remarkably, the novel PdIr0.1/S-1 catalyst demonstrated significantly enhanced activity even after undergoing harsh hydrothermal aging at 750 °C for 16 h, significantly outperforming the conventional Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

SACs exhibit remarkable advantages, including exceptional catalytic activity, excellent selectivity, and tunable reactivity to meet the specific requirements of diverse reactions.

The anionic electron layer formed between the electride and MoS2 can effectively modulate the charge distribution on the surface of MoS2, thereby enabling indirect manipulation of the performance of the SACs. There exists a robust linear correlation between the adsorption energy and charge variation, which serves as a pivotal descriptor of catalyst performance. The energy difference between the O* process structure and slab structure exhibits a strong linear correlation with the overpotential in the OER, making it a valuable criterion for efficient screening of electride-based heterogeneous catalysts which streamlines the screening process for OER catalysts.

Because of the presence of multiple bisphenols in environmental and food samples, it is urgent and challenging to develop a rapid and cheap technique for simultaneously detecting BPA and its analogues. In this study, a series of M-N-C (M = Cu, Mg, Ni, Co, Fe, K) single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) were created by simulating the structure of natural enzyme molecules, which were used as novel sensing platform for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors. Through systematic screening and characterization, it was interestingly discovered that the electrochemical sensor based on Cu-N-C SAzymes exhibited the best sensing performance for bisphenols among all SAzymes, which catalyzed not only BPA like tyrosinase, but also showed excellent catalytic capacity beyond tyrosinase (tyrosinase has no catalytic activity for BPS, BPAF, etc.), and achieved potential-resolved simultaneous rapid detection of BPA, BPS and BPAF. Further structure-activity relationship and catalytic mechanism characterizations of Cu-N-C SAzymes revealed that the presence of single atom Cu was predominantly in the form of Cu+ and Cu2+, which were anchored onto graphene nanosheet support through four coordination bonds with pyridinic N and pyrrolic N and acted as highly efficient active centers for electrocatalytic oxidation of bisphenols.

The ex situ sensing capability of the material was harnessed to detect pulmonary disorders by analyzing exhaled human breath. The material architecture facilitates two electrically isolated orthogonal pathways for sensing processes to proceed: one through the formation of interfacial bound states (identified at low temperatures via in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy) and the other through a polarity-induced p-dielectric-n heterostructure, selectively activated by the duration of surface catalytic interactions with the target analyte.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The hydrocracking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leading to the production of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) is one of most important industrial petrochemical processes. Although experiencing extensive experimental effort and industrial practice, the underlying hydrocracking reaction mechanisms of PAHs over zeolite-supported metal catalysts are still elusive. In particular, when, where, and how the aromatic rings of PAHs are open via C-C bond breaking is not clear. In the present work, the hydrocracking reaction pathways of anthracene over the HY zeolite encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst (Pt1/HY) as a demonstration case for the hydrocracking of PAHs have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ring-opening processes of the terminal and the central rings of anthracene with respect to the saturated hydrogenation degrees of aromatic rings and the hydrogen sources, which result in different BTX products, have been systematically examined. The hydride transfer over the same aromatic ring is facile, while it is kinetically hindered at the connecting C atoms (Ca) between the neighboring aromatic rings. The hydride transfer between the terminal and the central rings, in the case of the isomerization of 2,3-dihydroanthracene to 9,10-dihydroanthracene, can be achieved through the intermolecular hydride transfer mechanism with the assistance of anthracene. Compared to the hydrogenation from the Pt1 site, the addition of a proton from the Brønsted acidic sites (BAS) on the aromatic ring of partially hydrogenated anthracene would pronouncedly weaken the C-C bond, resulting in the central ring-opening process. DFT calculation results show the central ring opening is kinetically favorable in the anthracene hydrocracking over the Pt1/HY catalyst, generating BTX as the major product rather than butylbenzene and n-butane. The first protonation step by BAS on both rings is the most kinetically relevant step. In addition, the hydrocracking reaction of branched PAHs, using octylanthracene as the probe molecule, has also been investigated. It has been found that the dealkylation of octylanthracene at the ring-branched chain connection position is kinetically more feasible than the central ring opening and the cleavage of the octyl chain.

This striking difference is attributed to the local chemistry and specific location within zeolites; the interactions between single atoms and adsorbed reactants can significantly cleave Si-H bonds.

The solution lies in optimizing the binding strength of LiPSs and catalyzing the SRR. In this work, with the aid of density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, and machine learning (ML), we show that a heterostructure made out of graphene (Gra) and transition metal (TM) atom-anchored graphdiyne (GDY) effectively addresses both these issues. Our results show that the large triangular pores of GDY allow easy penetration of Li+ ions into the sulfur-intercalated TM-GDY/Gra heterostructures and result in LiPSs. The sparsely distributed TM atoms on the GDY surface tune the binding strength of LiPSs and act as catalysts for SRR. Based on the binding strength of LiPSs, TM atom catalysts are categorized into strong, moderate, and weak. Gibbs’s free-energy calculations reveal that heterostructures with moderate binding strength are best suited for SRR catalytic activity with barriers smaller than ∼0.4 eV. Furthermore, a Li2S decomposition barrier for the charging process is 3 times lower in the moderate class compared to pristine Gra. Feature importance analysis based on a gradient boosting regression ML model shows that the binding strength of LiPSs in the heterostructures is closely related to intrinsic electronic properties of TM and sulfur atoms, i.e., valence electronic configuration of the TM atom, electronegativity ratio of S to TM atom, and ionic radii of TM and S atoms. Furthermore, it also reveals that the energy barriers for the elementary steps of the SRR are related to the difference in the binding strength of LiPSs corresponding to the conversion step. This study elucidates the suitability of moderate binding heterostructures for LSBs; Fe, Co, Mn, and Rh are preferred single-atom catalysts to serve the purpose.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Atomically dispersed transition-metal catalysts have received increasing research interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the nature of the real active phase, specifically how the oxidation state of active species may affect the catalytic performance, remains elusive. In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on neural network potentials have been employed to assess the structural stability of 52 single- and dual-atom catalysts with transition metals including Mn-Cu, Ru-Ag, and Os-Au embedded in the metal or oxygen vacancies on the defective TiO2 surface. On the thermodynamically stable surfaces, microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations indicates the metal atoms stabilized in the Ti vacancies with a positive oxidation state generally promote propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with the assistance of adjacent O sites, whereas those in the O vacancies exhibiting metallic properties act as a sole active site for C-H bond activation. The scaling relations established show that the adsorption energies of H and H&H can be used as two simple but effective PDH activity descriptors across both positively charged and metallic metal-doped surfaces. The calculated TOF under the realistic experimental conditions reaches a maximum at a slightly negative oxidation state, implying the Pt and Ir in the metallic state would dominate the kinetics of PDH. Moreover, a high selectivity toward propylene may be attained because the scaling relation between the activation energies for the C-H bond breaking in propane and propylene is broken in the absence of multiple metallic metal-metal sites on the atomically dispersed catalysts. An understanding of this structure-activity relationship is of vital importance for the rational design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.',\n",

However, the proton transfer kinetics that significantly determines the activity of the proton-coupled electron reaction is largely dependent on the usage of an extensive noble-metal bulk phase. Herein, a well-designed dynamic acid-like catalyst system constructed by the metallic WO2 matrix and supported Ru single atoms (0.89 wt %) is grown on nickel foam (Ru SAC@WO2/NF). The as-prepared Ru SAC@WO2/NF free-standing catalyst exhibits superior activities of hydrogen evolution reaction with delivering current densities of 10, 50, and 200 mA/cm2 only requiring overpotentials of ∼0, 40, and 84 mV, respectively, and an ultralow Tafel slope (38 mV/dec) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, our deliberately prepared composite catalyst also shows long-term stability with negligible activity decay after continuous hydrogen generation at current densities of 10, 50, and 200 mA/cm2 for more than 50 h. Comprehensive spectroscopy characterizations combined with density function theory calculations reveal that the significantly improved activity of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction on the Ru SAC@WO2/NF free-standing catalyst can be understood by two reasons: (i) the metallic WO2 matrix contributes to the construction of an acid-like catalytic environment through the formation of weak-acid hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWOy) intermediates on the solid-liquid interface in an alkaline electrolyte; (ii) unlike the weak electronic interaction between Ru nanoparticles and hydrogen atoms of weak-acid HxWOy intermediates, Ru single atoms are evidenced to efficiently tailor the acidity of HxWOy intermediates for accelerated deprotonation kinetics, thus resulting in the regeneration of active sites for next catalytic cycle.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Advances in various clean energy conversion and storage technologies (e.g., fuel cells, water electrolysis, and metal-air batteries) require catalysts that are highly active, selective, and stable. Single-atom catalysts, with their unique structure, high atom utilization and well-defined active sites, have gained considerable attention in electrocatalysis. However, their practical applications are hindered by low metal loading and the fact that they comprise only a single specific type of active site. Integrating single atoms with nanoparticles (including clusters) into a single catalytic entity (SA/NPCs) has been demonstrated to be an effective way to overcome these challenges by synergizing different active species, thus leading to considerably enhanced catalytic performance. This review aims to provide a systematic summary of recent advances in this emerging field. First, we classify the integrated effects that contribute to the enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of SA/NPCs into the electron transfer effect, tandem effect, and parallel effect. Then, the realization and synthetic challenges of SA/NPCs are discussed based on two types of substrates, i.e., carbon- and metal-based carriers. Furthermore, we summarize and elaborate on the state-of-the-art applications of these catalysts in various electrochemical reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and other emerging electrocatalytic reactions such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction reactions. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with the development and implementation of this class of catalysts are highlighted to provide insights for future endeavors.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) are one of the most promising materials for the decomposition of chemical warfare nerve agents. We present a study of the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of nerve agent sarin catalyzed by Zn(II) and Ti(IV) single atoms on the Zr-MOF MOF-808. We reveal that upon binding of the nerve agent to the catalyst, conformational isomerism leads to a great diversity of hydrolysis reaction mechanisms. Each mechanism follows an addition-elimination sequence but differs markedly in the way the elimination step is accomplished and its energetics. Moreover, while most of the prior work has focused on the HF elimination channel, this work shows that the addition-elimination steps can also lead to isopropanol formation through barriers comparable to those of the HF channel. Additional insight is achieved by high-level electronic structure calculations, including coupled-cluster theory, which allow us to benchmark more efficient DFT techniques commonly used in mechanistic studies of catalytic processes involving transition-metal atoms. Overall, this work reveals new reaction pathways for nerve-agent hydrolysis with lower-lying transition-state energies than previously reported, highlighting the importance of conformational sampling in mechanistic studies of catalytic processes.',\n",

Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF-FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly-developed CF-FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open-circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF-FC based on a typical transition metal single-atom Fe-N-C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81 V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110 h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, < 1.0 V, < 50% retention over 20 h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF-FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel-series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2-O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large-scale practical applications.

Liquid and solid-state flexible zinc–air batteries employing FeN4-FeNCP@MCF both exhibit outstanding durability. Theoretical calculation reveals that the Fe nanoclusters can trigger remarkable electron redistribution of the FeN4 sites and modulate the hybridization of central Fe 3d and O 2p orbitals, facilitating the activation of O2 molecules and optimizing the adsorption capacity of oxygen-containing intermediates on FeN4 sites, and thus accelerating the ORR kinetic.

Production of chemicals via single-atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, a supramolecular-controlled pyrolysis strategy is employed to fabricate a palladium single-atom (Pd1/BNC) catalyst with B-doped Pd-Nx atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as-synthesized Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass-derived aldehydes/ketones. Thorough characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly polar metal-N-B site, formed between the central Pd single atom and its adjacent N and B atoms, promotes hydrogen activation from the donor (reductants) and hydrogen transfer to the acceptor (C═O group), consequently leading to exceptional selectivity. This system can be further extended to directly synthesize various aromatic and furonic amines from renewable lignocellulosic biomass, with their greenhouse gas emission potentials being negative in comparison to those of fossil-fuel resource-based amines.

Herein, we perform extensive calculations with explicit solvation to investigate the underlying mechanism of Cu SACs, disclosing the absence of C2+ activity in Cu1 sites regardless of the different substrates. The original Cu1 sites (first taking Cu1 stably anchored on carbon nitride as an example) cannot facilitate *CO hydrogenation and CO-CO coupling due to the lack of active sites nearby, and they are unstable under operation, causing leaching and aggregation to form small Cu clusters. The derived Cu clusters composed of at least three Cu atoms can efficiently promote CO-CO coupling, as revealed by kinetic analyses. We extend the modeling to other typical Cu SACs and reveal that all of the Cu1 sites are inactive, while the C2+ performance of the derived Cu-cluster catalysts is substrate-dependent.

Despite their clear structure, the origin of their exceptional activity remains elusive. Herein, we elucidate a common phenomenon of the hybridization state transition of metal centers, which is responsible for the activity origin across various SACs for different reactions. Focusing on N-doped carbon-supported Ni SAC (NiN4 SAC) for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), our comprehensive computations successfully clarify the hybridization state transition under working conditions and its relation with the activity. This transition, triggered by the reaction intermediates and applied potential, converts the Ni center from the inert dsp2 hybridization state to the active d2sp3 hybridization state. Importantly, the calculated activity and selectivity of the CO2RR over the d2sp3-hybridized Ni center are consistent with the experimental results, offering strong support for the proposed hypothesis. This work suggests a universal principle of electronic structure evolution in SACs that could revolutionize catalyst design, which also introduces a new paradigm for manipulating electronic states to enhance catalytic performance, with implications for various reactions and catalyst platforms.',\n",

Both the experiments and DFT calculations indicate that compared to the end-on adsorption of N2 on Fe1 catalysts, N2 activation is enhanced via the side-on adsorption on Fe3 catalysts, and the reaction follows the enzymatic pathway with a reduced free energy barrier for NRR. As a result, the Fe3 catalysts achieved better NRR performance (NH3 yield rate of 27.89 μg h-1 mg-1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 45.13%) than Fe1 catalysts (10.98 μg h-1 mg-1cat. and 20.98%).

Herein, we conducted a density functional theory (DFT) investigation to understand the effect of the replacement of O-atoms in Fe–O4–C by N-atoms in the first coordination shell of Fe-site (constructing five models: Fe–O4–C, Fe–O3N–C, Fe–N2O2–C, Fe–ON3–C and Fe–N4–C) towards ORR. The geometric and electronic calculations of these models suggested that replacing all the O-atoms with N-atoms around the Fe-site would make it more conducive to the adsorption of ORR intermediates. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy calculations demonstrated that the Fe-site becomes the active centre for 2e− ORR, leading to the dominant generation of H2O2 when Fe is coordinated with four O-atoms (Fe–O4–C). Whereas in compounds like Fe–N2O2–C, Fe–O3N–C, and Fe–N4–C, where the Fe-site displays 4e− ORR, form water is a preferred product if the O-atoms are replaced by N-atoms, as in Fe–N2O2–C, Fe–O3N–C, and Fe–N4–C.

The results show that the peripherally P-doped Zn1-N2C2 catalyst exhibits improved performance and stability compared to the undoped Zn1-N2C2. It is revealed that there is a linear relationship between the energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step of C3H8 and the H affinity of the active site. Furthermore, the peripheral P doping contributes to the stabilization of the tetra-coordination structure of Zn during catalysis, which in turn lowers the energy barrier for the second dehydrogenation step of C3H8.

Although the single atom provides a strategy to design and develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts that simultaneously maximizes the utilization of precious metal atoms, the stability of single atom catalysts is not satisfactory as a result of its high atomic surface energy. Here we construct a Pt1@CeO2 single atom catalyst (SAC) with excellent catalytic activity for benzene catalytic combustion (T90 = 212 °C) and low precious metal Pt loading, and even displaying an outstanding thermal stability and water resistance under the harsh conditions of 30,000 mL/g/h and 2000 ppm benzene. This Pt1@CeO2 catalyst was obtained by in situ domain limited encapsulation of Pt species in Ce-MOFs nanocages during the solvothermal reaction process. It is observed that lots of oxygen vacancies were created by the dislocation and phase transition of CeO2 to provide abundant sites for anchoring single atomic Pt, which can be localized and anchored firmly to oxygen vacancies, thus forming the highly stable Pt single atom. The atomically dispersed Pt is capable of improving the catalytic activity by forming Pt-O band. The good water resistance may be ascribed to the confined Pt single atom into oxygen vacancies of CeO2 support to form strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), and the PtOx nanoparticles would be easy to aggregate deactivation under water vapor conditions. It is a simple and universal strategy to prepare Pt SAC via the inherently confined space of MOFs nanocages formed by coordination of organic ligands and metal ions, which benefits from the functional modification of ethylene glycol in MOFs self-assembly reaction.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) driven by renewable electricity offers a green and sustainable technology for synthesizing chemicals and managing global carbon balance. However, developing electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for producing C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4) remains a daunting task. In this study, we conducted comprehensive first-principles calculations to investigate the eCO2RR mechanism using B-defective BC3-supported transition metal single-atom catalysts (TM@BC3 SACs). Initially, we evaluated the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of the designed 26 TM@BC3 SACs by calculating the binding energy and dissolution potential of the anchored TM atoms. Subsequently, the selectivity of the eCO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on stable SACs was determined by comparing the free energy change (ΔG) for the first protonation of CO2 with the ΔG of *H formation. The stability and selectivity screening processes enabled us to narrow down the pool of SACs to the 14 promising ones. Finally, volcano plots for the eCO2RR towards different C1 products were established by using the adsorption energy descriptors of key intermediates, and three SACs were predicted to exhibit high activity and selectivity. The limiting potentials (UL) for HCOOH production on Pd@BC3 and Ag@BC3 are −0.11 V and −0.14 V. CH4 is a preferred product on Re@BC3 with UL of −0.22 V. Elaborate electronic structure calculations elucidate that the activity and selectivity originate from the sufficient activation of the C-O bond and the strong orbital hybridization between crucial intermediates and metal atoms. The proposed catalyst screening criteria, constructed volcano plots and predicted SACs may provide a theoretical foundation for the development of computationally guided catalyst designs for electrochemical CO2 conversion to C1 products.',\n",

The practical implementation of PEC systems hinges on addressing three critical challenges: enhancing energy conversion efficiency, ensuring long-term stability, and achieving economic viability. Metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) heterojunction photoelectrodes have gained significant attention over the last decade for their ability to efficiently segregate photogenerated carriers and mitigate corrosion-induced semiconductor degradation. This review discusses the structural composition and interfacial intricacies of MIS photoelectrodes tailored for PEC water splitting. The application of MIS heterostructures across various semiconductor light-absorbing layers, including traditional photovoltaic-grade semiconductors, metal oxides, and emerging materials, is presented first. Subsequently, this review elucidates the reaction mechanisms and respective merits of vacuum and non-vacuum deposition techniques in the fabrication of the insulator layers. In the context of the metal layers, this review extends beyond the conventional scope, not only by introducing metal-based cocatalysts, but also by exploring the latest advancements in molecular and single-atom catalysts integrated within MIS photoelectrodes. Furthermore, a systematic summary of carrier transfer mechanisms and interface design principles of MIS photoelectrodes is presented, which are pivotal for optimizing energy band alignment and enhancing solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency within the PEC system. Finally, this review explores innovative derivative configurations of MIS photoelectrodes, including back-illuminated MIS photoelectrodes, inverted MIS photoelectrodes, tandem MIS photoelectrodes, and monolithically integrated wireless MIS photoelectrodes. These novel architectures address the limitations of traditional MIS structures by effectively coupling different functional modules, minimizing optical and ohmic losses, and mitigating recombination losses.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion active sites have exhibited huge potentials in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like chemistry in water purification. However, four-N coordination metal (MN4) moieties often suffer from such problems as low selectivity and narrow workable pH. How to construct SACs in a controllable strategy with optimized electronic structures is of great challenge. Herein, an innovative strategy (i.e., the “4 + 1” fabrication) was devised to precisely modulate the first-shell coordinated microenvironment of FeN4 SAC using an additional N (SA-FeN5). This leads to almost 100% selective formation of high-valent iron-oxo [Fe(IV)=O] (steady-state concentration: 2.00 × 10−8 M) in the SA-FeN5/PMS system. In-depth theoretical calculations unveil that FeN5 configuration optimizes the electron distribution of monatomic Fe sites, which thus fosters PMS adsorption and reduces the energy barrier for Fe(IV)=O generation. SA-FeN5 was then attached to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for a continuous flow device, showing long-term abatement of the microcontaminant. This work furnishes a general strategy for effective PMS activation and selective high-valent metal-oxo species generation by high N-coordination number regulation in SACs, which would provide guidance in the rational design of superior environmental catalysts for water purification.',\n",

The introduction of the vertical oxygen atom breaks the symmetric charge balance, modulating the binding strength to oxygen intermediates and decreasing the energy barrier for the ORR process. As expected, the prepared Sn SAC exhibits outstanding ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.912 V (vs RHE) and an excellent mass activity of 13.1 A mgSn-1 at 0.850 V (vs RHE), which surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and most reported transition-metal-based SACs. Additionally, the reported Sn SAC shows excellent ORR stability due to the strong interaction between Sn sites and the carbon support with oxygen atom as the bridge. The excellent ORR performance of Sn SAC was also proven by both liquid- and solid-state zinc-air battery (ZAB) measurements, indicating its great potential in practical applications.',\n",

This study reports the identification of isolated Ni/Cu atomic pairs dispersed on a BiOCl surface (Ni1/Cu1-BOC) as a promising candidate for efficient HCO3− reduction under UV-vis light irradiation. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits a high CO formation rate of 157.1 μmol g−1 h−1 with nearly 100% selectivity, even in the absence of added proton sources, sacrificial agents, or sensitizers.

The Co1/PNbA and Pt1/PNbA catalysts showed marvelous OER and ORR performance. Co1/PNbA (0.50/0.35 V) and Pt1/PNbA (0.50/0.39 V) have significantly lower overpotentials than previously reported OER/ORR catalysts.

It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe-N4 site without the Fe nanoparticles (NPs) sintering during the Fe−N−C synthesis via high-temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe−N−C synthesis at low temperatures.

Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron-withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value-added process, we introduce earth-abundant Ti single-atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen-doped carbon nanosheets (Ti−CNO) by a two-step method. The Ti−CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti−CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3 %, much higher than CN (27.1 %). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide⋅+ and CO2⋅− radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Tiδ+) and basic sites of Ti−CNO under light irradiation, respectively.

Thanks to the synergism achieved by the bonding interaction of adjacent Pt and Ag single-atom pairs, the developed Pt1Ag1-a/CN with 0.21% Pt loading shows a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1115 h−1 with a H2 evolution rate (HER) of 12,000 μmol g−1 h−1 for photocatalytic water splitting under simulated solar light irradiation (325 h−1 of TOF with 3480 μmol g−1 h−1 of HER under visible light irradiation). This strategy outperforms the previously reported SACs on CN-based semiconductors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the adjacent Ag atom acts as a coordination atom to effectively regulate the electronic structure of the Pt atom and thus brings the d-band center of Pt close to the Fermi energy level, which is beneficial for the H2 production. This work presents a facile and general strategy for designing diverse adjacent diatomic cocatalysts in photocatalysis without depressing light absorption by the deposited carbon during the DAC preparation via previously reported methods.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single-atom catalysts (SACs) and cluster catalysts are increasingly recognized as powerful materials for electrocatalysis, especially in the field of sustainable energy storage and conversion. SACs have the advantages of low metal loading and high atom utilization efficiency, but the free energy of the surface area tends to make individual atom unstable, making them prone to agglomeration during synthesis and catalytic reactions. Cluster catalysts with high atom utilization and different active sites can overcome the limitations of single-atom catalysts for continuous and collective adsorption as well as activation of reactants or intermediates. The synergistic effect resulting from the competition between single-atom and cluster catalysts can significantly improve the performance of the catalysts. Ru-based catalysts have important application prospects in catalysis. Accurate design of the geometrical and electronic structures of Ru-based single-atom and cluster catalysts and the unraveling of their structure-property relationships face great challenges. Herein, we classify and compare these catalysts, with a special focus on Ru-based homologous and heterologous catalysts. Next, we show several major breakthroughs in electrocatalysis catalyzed by Ru-based single-atom and clusters. In recent years, Ru-based catalysts have made significant progress in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), so we focus on the application of Ru-based catalysts in HER and cover other electrocatalytic reactions, bifunctional reactions (HER/oxygen evolution reaction, HER/hydroxide oxidation reaction), and electrochemical organic reactions. In addition, the review summarizes the catalytic mechanism of HER on Ru-based single-atom and clusters.

       "  'ABSTRACT': \"Context: Hydrogen sulfide gas poses significant risks to both human health and the environment, with the potential to induce respiratory and neurological effects, and a heightened fatality risk at elevated concentrations. This article investigates the catalytic decomposition of H2S on a Sc-Ti3C2O2 single-atom catalyst(SAC) using the density functional theory-based first-principles calculation approach. Initially, the adsorption behavior of H2S on Ti3C2O2-MXene was examined, revealing weak physical adsorption between them. Subsequently, the transition metal atom Sc was introduced to the Ti3C2O2 surface, and its stability was studied, demonstrating high stability. Further exploration of H2S adsorption on Sc-Ti3C2O2 revealed direct dissociation of H2S gas molecules into HS* and H*, with HS* binding to Sc and H* binding to O on the Ti3C2O2 surface, resulting in OH groups. Using the transition state search method, the dissociation of H2S molecules on the SAC's surface was investigated, revealing a potential barrier of 2.45 eV for HS* dissociation. This indicates that the H2S molecule can be dissociated into H2 and S with the action of the Sc-Ti3C2O2 SAC. Moreover, the S atom left on the catalyst surface can aggregate to produce elemental S8, desorbing on the catalyst surface, completing the catalytic cycle. Consequently, the Sc-Ti3C2O2 SAC is poised to be an efficient catalyst for the catalytic decomposition of H2S. Methods: The Dmol3 module in Materials Studio software based on density functional theory is used in this study. The generalized gradient approximation method GGA-PBE is used for the exchange–correlation function. The complete LST/QST and the NEB methods in the Dmol3 module were used to study the minimum energy path of the dissociation of hydrogen sulfide molecules on the catalyst surface.\",\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Enhancing the conversion of insoluble Li2S2-Li2S to improve sulfur utilization has become an essential strategy for Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The proposed approach employs single-atom catalysts (SACs) known for their high atomic usage efficiency to enable in-situ reactions with Li2S2. However, the origin and mechanisms of various SACs involved in the Li2S2 to Li2S reduction reaction are not fully elucidated. Herein, we reveal the underlying mechanism of Li2S2-Li2S reduction catalysis on Mn atoms by examining the electronic structure of d orbitals. Theoretical calculations indicate that substituting a S atom for N in the first coordination structure of Mn SACs elevates the Mn d-band center and simultaneously enhances the hybridization between the Mn d orbitals and the p orbitals of sulfur species. This alteration not only improves the anchoring of lithium polysulfides, leading to better adsorption but also accelerates the conversion kinetics of Li2S2 to Li2S due to the improved intrinsic catalytic activity of SACs. As a result, the Li-S batteries equipped with the SAMn-based cathode deliver an impressive initial capacity of 1343.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, exceptional rate capability of 782.4 mAh g−1 at 3 C, and maintain a low degradation rate of approximately 0.025% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Furthermore, with a sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2, the S/SAMn@NSC cathode achieves a reversible areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C.

This study examines the structure, electronic properties, CO2 adsorption configurations, and the transition states and Gibbs free energy of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on noble metal Pt/g-C3N4 doped, single-atom Fe/g-C3N4 doped, and bimetallic Fe/Co doped g-C3N4 catalysts, revealing the mechanisms of catalyst-mediated CO2 reduction. The results demonstrate that the introduction of Fe/Co bimetallic atoms leads to more efficient charge transfer, attributed to the synergistic and electronic effects of the bimetallic coupling, with a charge of 1.264, which is 2.2 and 1.2 times greater than that of Pt and Fe doped g-C3N4, respectively. Furthermore, the stronger adsorption energy of CO2 molecules on Fe/Co/g-C3N4 compared to pure g-C3N4, Pt/g-C3N4, and Fe/g-C3N4 indicates that adsorption on Fe/Co/g-C3N4 is more conducive to CO2 activation. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) calculations reveal that Fe/Co/g-C3N4 exhibits a lower reaction barrier of 0.789 eV compared to noble metal-doped Pt and single-atom Fe, due to the reduction of the reaction mechanism's energy barrier by the Fe/Co bimetallic doped g-C3N4, which facilitates a more effective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. As a result, Fe/Co/g-C3N4 emerges as an effective alternative to noble metal-based photocatalysts.

That is, two •OH species reaction in the liquid environment which originated from the creaking of *OOH intermediates due to the weakened O-O bond by the interaction with surrounding water.

Here, we rationally designed a metal-chelated ionic liquid (M-IL) as a cornerstone (single source) to synthesize highly efficient M-SAC electrocatalysts via a robust and straightforward approach for ORR, OER, and HER reactions. The effect of temperature, as well as various metals (Fe, Co, Cu, Ni), on the formation of the M-SAC catalyst, was meticulously investigated. Among the designed single-atom catalysts, IL-Fe-SAC-8 delivered superior methanol tolerance toward ORR with a higher half-wave potential (0.902 V vs. RHE) and lower potential values of −0.127 V and 1.511 V vs. RHE, achieving a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 toward HER and OER reactions. Thanks to the optimal graphitization, abundant defects, enhanced surface area, and high atomic coordination (supported by HAADF & XANES) of IL-Fe-SAC-8. Furthermore, the flexible DMFC assembled using IL-Fe-SAC-8 cathode delivered 2.5 times higher power density than the Pt/C-based cathode. When we tested a bifunctional IL-Fe-SAC-8||IL-Fe-SAC-8 electrolyzer, it achieved 1.58 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, for the real-time demonstration, we powered an H-type membrane water electrolyzer (separated by AEM) with a windmill and measured the hydrogen and oxygen produced concerning wind speeds. Furthermore, the produced hydrogen gas is used to power the lab-scale hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.

Lowering metal loading without sacrificing activity and durability is highly desired for the catalyst design, especially for those reactions where the noble metals deliver the best catalyzing performance. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximal metal-atom utilization, homogeneous and tailorable active sites have emerged as promising catalyst candidates, where the local coordination structures of the metal atoms in SACs largely determine the reaction kinetics. Previous design strategies of constructing strong metal-support interactions can stabilize the individual metal atoms in SACs, but present obstacles to provide a flexible manipulation platform for elaborately tailoring the coordination structures to achieve performance optimization towards a specifically targeted reaction. Here, for the proof-of-concept study, we report a novel design of SAC with iridium (Ir) single atoms supported on conjugated polymer, in which the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates on Ir atoms and the reaction kinetics towards acidic water oxidation can be readily optimized through modulating the formed cation-π interactions that can be tailored by adjusting the molecular structures of conjugated polymers.

Molecular dynamic (MD) calculations show that mean square displacement (MSD) of PDS, BPA, and H2O molecules in the nanotunnels decreases obviously with smaller pore size. Due to the confinement, the BPA (di = 1.0 nm) and PDS (di = 0.5 nm) can easily enter and confined in the cavities of Zn-N-C-RDM. PDS can be therefore activated more easily to degrade BPA due to their faster diffusion and shorter transfer routes. > 97 % degradation of BPA can therefore be achieved by Zn-N-C-RDM within 20 min. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and open circuit potential (OCP) results indicate that O2•− radical dominate the degradation.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) offers a promising strategy for carbon neutrality, as it avoids the energy-intensive and carbon-emitting industrial processes. The exploration of high-efficiency N2 photofixation systems for photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (pNRR) is critical but it remains a challenge since the lack of rational structural design and atomic-level insights into molecular N2 activation mechanism. Herein, an atomically dispersed single-atom palladium (Pd) active sites decorated oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide (Pd/MoO3-x) was creatively designed for assessing pNRR performance. Interestingly, the integration of single-atom Pd active sites in MoO3-x can significantly weaken the N≡N bond of adsorbed N2 and effectively lower the activation energy barrier during the pNRR process. This is attributed to the fact that the modified Pd single-atom sites of Pd/MoO3-x play a dominant role in the N2 spontaneous adsorption process as well as possess a remarkable photogenerated electron trapping ability, which could be assisted to inject electrons into N2 antibonding orbital, thus significantly accelerates the reaction kinetics. Consequently, the Pd/MoO3-x photocatalyst reaches an impressive NH3 yield rate of 103.2 μggcat.−1h−1, which is superior to that of pristine MoO3-x (21.2 μggcat.−1h−1) and commercial MoO3 (6.5 μggcat.−1h−1), respectively.

The ideal tandem catalyst should possess three separated active sites to drive three subsequent reaction steps, including water decomposition to construct a local acid-like microenvironment, H3O+ migration, and H2 production under alkaline conditions, respectively. Taking the Pt single atom anchored on CoV layered double hydroxides (Pt/CoV-LDHs) as a prototypical example, we have successfully constructed a local acid-like microenvironment and realized remarkable alkaline HER performances using theoretical prediction and experimental verification. In situ Raman spectroscopy observes the emergence of a key H3O+ intermediate. The further analysis reveals the mechanism of tandem catalysis that water molecule adsorbs on V site with the assistance of oxygen vacancy in CoV-LDHs; V and Co sites play synergistic role in dissociating water to construct a local acid-like microenvironment; Co sites transport H3O+ intermediate to Pt site for HER which undergoes Volmer-Tafel mechanism with fast kinetics.

By optimizing the mass proportion of BC to SA Fe-N-C during co-pyrolysis, the stack structure of two componants was successfully fabricated. The built-in electric field (BIEF) is induced by the defect position of graphite carbon structure in BC and the electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom in SA Fe-N-C. The electron transport road from BC to SA Fe-N-C was established by using the BIEF between the interfaces. As a result, the non-covalent stack of BC/SA Fe-N-C rendered a promising way in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and meanwhile exhibited superior stability concerning their robust geometric skeleton. The degradation experiments showed that the degradation efficiency of the composite was increased to 91% compared with that of the pristine SA Fe-N-C (69%) at a extremely higher concentration of TC (20 mg/L). Based on theoretical calculations and in-situ detections, it was found that the PMS activation follows the route of generating radicals (SO4•–,•OH) and non-radical (1O2, Fe(V)=O).

In the present work, a new concept of SACs is proposed with the capacity to form d-p orbital hybridization.

Nevertheless, investigating the structure-performance relationship between MoS2 and deposited metal still presents a formidable challenge, yet a highly desirable pursuit. In this study, a Cu-MoS2 single-atom catalyst (SAC) was successfully synthesized by a photo-deposition method, wherein Cu ions were deposited on the MoS2 surface. The Cu-MoS2/PMS system exhibits exceptional degradation performance for tetracycline (TC), with a removal efficiency reaching 96% at 60 min. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) is applied to investigate the coordination microenvironment of the catalyst by depositing of Cu. Experimental and theoretical calculations results exhibit that, on one hand, the introduction of Cu decreases the adsorption energy barrier and enhances the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for PMS. On the other hand, the abundant presence of Cu on the surface of the MoS2 facilitates an accelerated transfer of electron, availing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the distinct pathway: MoS2 → transition metal → PMS. Concurrently, the synergistic interaction between Mo and Cu expedites rapid valence evolution of Mo4+/Mo5+/Mo6+ and Cu+/Cu2+, thereby further enhancing the PMS activation.

Recent advancements in the design and comprehension of catalytic materials and electrolyte systems have steadily enhanced the performance of CO2 electroreduction (CO2ERR). Among the promising materials for CO2 electroreduction, transition metals, such as manganese, nickel, iron, and cobalt, have gained prominence due to their availability in contrast to expensive noble metals. This review delves into the more recent advances on the utilization of molecular catalysts and single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide and other C1 molecules. The utilization of catalysts based on organometallic molecular complexes has demonstrated notable efficiency. This approach enables the fine-tuning of the electrical and coordination characteristics of the metal center, thereby enhancing metal utilization, reducing poisoning events, and allowing for selectivity control. While much of the research has traditionally focused on homogeneous CO2 electroreduction, recent years have seen increasing attention towards the heterogenization of molecular catalysts. The main organometallic complexes presented in this review are cobalt and iron porphyrin, cobalt phtalocyanine and manganese bipyridine, anchored on carbon-based electrodes. Moreover, single-atom catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for driving CO2ERR, due to their exceptional performance. Among these catalysts, the single-atom Metal-Nitrogen-Carbon (M-N-C) structure stands out as particularly promising. Additionally, the incorporation of nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen to dope the carbon support can ensure a uniform distribution of the atomic metal within the catalyst. Here, iron, cobalt and nickel SACs are outlined, presenting diverse support materials and operating conditions. Both SACs and molecular catalysts have demonstrated commendable Faradaic efficiencies, indicating their capability to convert CO2 into CO with a high degree of selectivity.

Herein, we developed an electronic structure engineering on carbon nano frameworks embedded with nitrogen and sulfur asymmetrically dual-coordinated indium active sites toward the efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. As expected, atomically dispersed In-based catalysts with In-S1N3 atomic interface with asymmetrically coordinated exhibited high efficiency for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate. It achieved a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.3% towards formate generation at −0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), outperforming that of catalysts with In-S2N2 and In-N4 atomic interface. And at a potential of −1.10 V vs. RHE, In-S1N3 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 93.7% in flow cell. The catalytic performance of In-S1N3 sites was confirmed to be enhanced through in-situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements under electrochemical conditions.

The slow kinetics of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has a major impact on the performance of PEMFCs, and although platinum (Pt) can accelerate the reaction rate of the ORR, the scarcity and high cost of Pt resources still limit the development of PEMFCs. Therefore, the development of low-cost high-performance ORR catalysts is essential for the commercial application and development of PEMFCs.

Using density functional theory calculations, we investigate charge-dependent configurations of Cu-Ni dimers anchored on TiO2 by the mixing of individual constituent atoms. The d electron-donating ability determines deposition sequence and position of transition metal atoms on oxides, establishing dimer pattern and metal–support interactions. The interaction between Cu and Ni, beyond the coordination environment, predominately contributes to the synergistic effect. A complex adsorption–reduction behavior of H species on CuNi/TiO2 is observed. The reaction mechanism and catalytic activity of CuNi/TiO2 for hydrogen production are explored. At room temperature and high H coverages, CuNi/TiO2 shows better performance and efficiency than Ni1/TiO2.

However, carbon-based SACs usually aggregate during pyrolysis, which leads to the reduction of catalytic activity. Here, we describe a method to improve the monodispersion of SACs using silicon dioxide as a protective layer. The decoration of silicon dioxide serves as a buffer layer for individual nanoparticles, which is not destroyed during the pyrolysis process, ensuring the single-particle dispersion of the nanoparticles after etching. This approach increased the hydroxyl groups on the surface of Fe-SAC (Fe-SAC-SE) and improved its water solubility, resulting in a four times enhancement of the peroxidase (POD)-like activity of Fe-SAC-SE (58.4 U/mg) than that of non-protected SACs (13.9 U/mg). The SiO2-protection approach could also improve the catalytic activities of SACs with other metals such as Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu, indicating its generality for SACs preparation. Taking advantage of the high POD-like activity, photothermal properties, and large specific surface area of Fe-SAC-SE, we constructed a synergistic therapeutic system (Fe-SAC-SE@DOX@PEG) for combining the photothermal therapy, catalytic therapy, and chemotherapy. It was verified that the photothermal properties of Fe-SAC-SE@DOX@PEG could effectively improve its POD-like activity, exhibiting excellent tumor-killing performance at the cellular level.

Atoms of metal nanoparticles on cathode are firstly disbanded under high negative voltage, and emitted into the electrolyte in the form of atomic metal anions in Zintl phase.

Herein, nitro compounds hydrogenation catalyzed by N-doped carbon-supported Co single atom (Co1/NC) was taken as a model to uncover the mechanism of the reversible deactivation phenomenon. Co1/NC exhibited moderate adsorption towards the substrate molecules (i.e., nitro compounds or related intermediates), which could be strengthened by the confinement effect from the porous structure. Consequently, substrate molecules tend to accumulate within the pore channel, especially micropores that host Co1, making it difficult for the reactants to access the active sites and finally leading to their deactivation. The situation could be even worse when the substrate molecules possess a large size. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity of Co1/NC could be restored via a simple thermal treatment, which could remove the adsorbates within the pore channel, hence releasing active sites that were originally inaccessible to reactants.',\n",

Encouraging, the optimized Ce−Se diatomic catalysts (Ce−Se DAs/NC) displayed a half-wave potential of 0.886 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and excellent stability, which surpass those of separate Ce or Se single atoms and most single/dual atomic catalysts ever reported.

Although optimizing the local electronic structure of single atom can greatly improve their catalytic activity, it often involves in-plane modulation and requires high temperatures. Herein, we report a novel strategy to manipulate the local electronic structure of SACs via the modulation of axial Co–S bond anchored onto graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) at room temperature (RT). Each Co atom is bonded to four N atoms and one S atom (Co-(N, S)/C3N4). Owing to the greater electronegativity of S in the Co–S bond, the local electronic structure of the Co atoms is available to be controlled at a relatively moderate level. Consequently, when employed for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, the adsorption energy of intermediate hydrogen (H*) on the Co atoms is remarkably low. In the presence of the Co-(N, S)/C3N4 SACs, the hydrogen evolution rates reach up to 10 mmol/(gh), which is nearly 10 and 2.5 times greater than the rates in the presence of previously reported transition metal/C3N4 and noble platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs)/C3N4 catalysts, respectively. Attributed to the tailorable axial Co-S bond in the SAC, the local electronic structure of the Co atoms can be further optimized for other photocatalytic reactions. This axial coordination engineering strategy is universal in catalyst designing and can be used for a variety of photocatalytic applications.',\n",

Here the ORR catalytic performance of Fe–N4–C is investigated at the quantum level. Increasing the number of N atoms, by replacing C, near the Fe-N4 moiety, increases the ORR activity. The substitution of C with N causes a local redistribution of charge, and if near to the Fe atom, this induces charge modification of the Fe atom; specifically, electrons transfer from the dxz and dyz orbitals to the dz2 orbital. Due to its geometry, the change in the dz2 orbital occupation directly impacts the bonding interaction between Fe and oxygen-containing intermediates, thus impacting the ORR catalytic performance.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Lithium‑sulfur (Li–S) batteries play an important role in the energy field, offering a potential solution for low-cost energy storage with high energy density. However, the slow reaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) during the discharge process hinder the practical application of Li–S batteries. Furthermore, the complex sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and its electrocatalytic mechanism remain unclear, impeding research on high-performance batteries. To gain a deeper understanding of the electrocatalytic mechanism, this study employs density functional theory to simulate the adsorption, reaction pathways, catalytic decomposition, and diffusion of LiPSs on N-doped carbon nanosheets with single-atom embedding (M-N4/G). The simulation reveals the chemical mechanism of Li–S battery SRR, where the adsorption energy of LiPSs serves as a crucial descriptor for predicting reaction pathways, rate-limiting steps, and overpotential. The results indicate that the d-p coupling between V-N4/G and LiPSs reduces the energy barrier of rate-limiting steps (2.19 eV), facilitating SRR to proceed along the minimum energy path and thereby enhancing reaction kinetics.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The Pt1/CeO2 single-atom catalyst excels across catalytic fields, promising applications in the oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Here, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the ORR mechanism catalyzed by Pt1/CeO2 systems and the activity regulated by Ce3+ polarons. We determine the reaction pathways of different Pt1/CeO2 systems by evaluating four critical factors: O2 adsorption energy, O2 dissociation Gibbs barrier, Gibbs free energy change for O2→OOH*, and H2O2 adsorption structure. Notably, most Pt1/CeO2 systems tend to react through the 4e− associative path. Theoretical activity calculations reveal that PtOH/CeO2(110) system show low overpotential of 0.47 V comparable to pure Pt. The excellent ORR activity is attributed to the synergistic mechanism of Pt and surrounding Ce3+ polarons, where the polaron regulation mechanism dominates the reaction. The quantity of Ce3+ polarons not only affects the reaction active sites but also regulates the radical adsorption state. With an elevated Ce3+ polarons concentration, the ORR overpotential in Pt1/CeO2 system can decrease from 0.47 to 0.16 V, leading to a substantial enhancement in activity. This work first underscores the crucial involvement of Ce3+ polarons in catalyzing the ORR, reducing the significance of Pt in catalysis, inspiring a new way to design active non-platinum electrocatalysts for ORR in experiments.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Most of the nanozymes have been obtained based on trial and error, for which the application is usually compromised by enzymatic activity regulation due to a vague catalytic mechanism. Herein, a hollow axial Mo-Pt single-atom nanozyme (H-MoN5@PtN4/C) is constructed by a two-tier template capture strategy. The axial ligand can induce Mo 4d orbital splitting, leading to a rearrangement of spin electrons (↑ ↑ → ↑↓) to regulate enzymatic activity. This creates catalase-like activity and enhances oxidase-like activity to catalyze cascade enzymatic reactions (H2O2 → O2 → O2•-), which can overcome tumor hypoxia and accumulate cytotoxic superoxide radicals (O2•-). Significantly, H-MoN5@PtN4/C displays destructive d−π conjugation between the metal and substrate to attenuate the restriction of orbitals and electrons. This markedly improves enzymatic performance (catalase-like and oxidase-like activity) of a Mo single atom and peroxidase-like properties of a Pt single atom. Furthermore, the H-MoN5@PtN4/C can deplete overexpressed glutathione (GSH) through a redox reaction, which can avoid consumption of ROS (O2•- and •OH).

Herein, we combined theoretical calculations with experimental verifications to comprehensively investigate the O3 activation mechanisms on a series of conventional SAC structures with N-doped nanocarbon substrates (MN4-NCs, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The synergetic manipulation effect of the metal atom and M-OH on O3 activation pathways was paid particular attention. O3 tends to directly interact with the metal atom on MnN4-NC, FeN4-NC, and NiN4-NC catalysts, among which MnN4-NC has the best catalytic activity for its relatively lower activation energy barrier of O3 (0.62 eV) and more active surface-adsorbed oxygen species (Oads). On the CoN4-NC catalyst, direct interaction of O3 with the metal site is energetically infeasible, but O3 can be activated to generate Oads or HO2 species from direct or indirect participation of M-OH sites. The experimental results showed that 90.7 and 82.3% of total organic carbon (TOC) was removed within 40 min during catalytic ozonation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid with MnN4-NC and CoN4-NC catalysts, respectively.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The selectivity of syngas-to-C2 oxygenates still faces a big challenge. Using density functional theory calculation methods, this study explores the influence of the confined environment of Rh active sites on the reaction performance of syngas conversion to CHx over four types of RhCu confined catalysts, which further reveals the essential reasons of the confinement effect to regulate the catalytic performance. The results showed that the confined environment of Rh active sites in the RhCu confined catalysts can regulate the activity and selectivity of syngas conversion to generate CHx. The screened RhGCN5.5 catalyst could perform the highest catalytic activity toward syngas conversion to generate CHx (x=1-3) monomer. The moderate confinement effect of RhGCN5.5 catalyst made the d-band center of surface atoms far away from the Fermi level, leading to an appropriate electron gain and loss between the transition state of CH2OH dissociation and RhCu surface, which was conducive to the dissociation of CH2OH into CH2 and thus exhibited excellent CHx formation activity. This study provides theoretical basis for improving the catalytic performance of syngas conversion to C2 oxygenates by adjusting the confined environment of active site and provides the structural clues for the design of the confined metal single-atom catalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The utilization of Bi/Sn alloy-based materials has garnered significant interest as a promising avenue for the development of sodium-ion batteries and the achievement of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This is due to their notable attributes of high theoretical specific capacity and low working potential, as well as their abundance and high catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the practical application potential of these alloys is restrained by their inadequate electrical conductivity without incorporating conductive carbon networks to improve the electrical conductivity of the composite material and consequential volumetric fluctuations, which ultimately lead to unsatisfactory cycle life and the depletion of active components. A single-atom Bi-coated Sn nanoparticle was synthesized utilizing metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds as precursors. The resulting composite exhibits the ability to mitigate volume changes that arise during charge and discharge processes, while also enhancing the catalytic activity of the system for CO2 reduction through synergistic effects. Upon pyrolysis of the MOFs at elevated temperatures, a carbon matrix “protective layer” is formed to prevent the loss of active substances under conditions of electrode pulverization. This leads to improved cycle stability and coulomb efficiency of the battery. The ion permeation and gas diffusion are facilitated by the three-dimensional porous structures of composites. The conductive networks further improve the conductivity of materials, prevent the shedding of electrode material from electrodes, and facilitate electron transport. Consequently, the electrode demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, as evidenced by a high capacity of 510 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles and a reversible capacity of 497 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the composite material demonstrates a notable degree of selectivity towards CO2 reduction, as evidenced by a coulombic efficiency of 95.7% for HCOOH at a potential of −1.1 V but only a coulombic efficiency of 2.3% for H2. Furthermore, the composite material exhibits commendable stability. The findings presented in this study offer valuable technical insights towards the attainment of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Modulation of the electronic structure of heterogeneous catalysts by introducing heterojunctions is an effective means to improve their catalytic performance. Although Co-based nanocatalysts have been widely used in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) wastewater, Co single-atom catalysts (SACs) have rarely been reported. Herein, we successfully fabricate Co SACs supported on CNT/MoS2 heterojunction nanocomposite (Co1-MoS2/CNT) by a hydrothermal synthesis combined with the subsequent impregnation method. The catalytic performance of Co1-MoS2/CNT is evaluated using the reduction of 4-NP in an aqueous media containing sodium borohydride. Complete reduction of 4-NP catalyzed by Co1-MoS2/CNT occurs within 5 min at room temperature, and the apparent rate constant k can reach 1.16 min−1, which is 4.1 and 38.6 times higher than those of Co1-CNT and Co1-MoS2, respectively. The improved catalytic performance of Co1-MoS2/CNT is attributed to the p-n heterojunctions of MoS2/CNT increasing the electron density of the Co single-atom sites, as well as the CNTs with excellent conductivity, accelerating the electron transfer. Moreover, Co1-MoS2/CNT exhibits excellent stability and favorable applicability, endowing its potential for practical applications. Our findings not only provide useful insights into the enhancement of catalytic performance of SACs, but also open a new avenue for the treatment of 4-NP wastewater.',\n",

However, the present efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the low atomic availability and the few active sites of nanozyme. Herein, by means of density functional theory calculations, the catalytic performance of substituted or interstitial single transition metals doped in chlorapatite matrix (TM-CAP) for Fenton/Fenton-like reaction was systematically studied, aiming to screen out efficient and highly cyclic single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes). The Coint-CAP SAzymes showed unprecedented superiority among all candidates with the limit potential of −1.92 V under the characteristic acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment, and exhibited excellent catalyst regeneration ability compared with neutral conditions. Ultimately, it is proved that compared with substitution doping, the interstitial doping of single Co atom significantly improves the inherent activity of Fenton/Fenton-like reaction. This was ascribed to the charge rearrangement of SAzymes surface caused by interstitial doping of Co, which enabled Ca site near the Co site to stably synergistically bind *OH species. Moreover, the screened Co interstitial doped chlorapatite (Coint-CAP) SAzymes with excellent thermodynamic stability and anti-agglomeration ability not only had a smaller cell volume change and band gap, but also was easy to be synthesized experimentally.

Herein, g-C3N4 nanorods with diameters of 9.0 and 7.0 nm are synthesized via the hard template approach to support single-atom Co for the catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane. Comprehensive characterizations, combined with theoretical calculations, find that the curved structure would broaden the space of g-C3N4 interlayers, modulate the electronic structure, and reduce the coordination number of atomic Co. The mechanism study reveals that compared with Co atoms on a flat g-C3N4 surface, the low-coordinated Co atoms anchored on a curved g-C3N4 surface are capable of enhancing the reactant adsorption and facilitating the oxygen dissociation, thereby boosting the catalytic cyclohexane oxidation. The cyclohexane conversion on resultant Co/g-C3N4-9 nm reaches up to 22.4% at the overall selectivity of above 95% under mild reaction conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art nonprecious metal-based catalysts.

Utilizing a backward elimination method and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) training, the key descriptors correlated with the target properties of the catalysts were identified. The SISSO descriptors, consisting of structural and electronic characteristic parameters, are interpretable and provide meaningful insights.

However, Fe-N-C cathodes for PEMFC are made thicker than Pt/C ones, in order to compensate for the lower intrinsic ORR activity and site density of Fe-N-C materials. The thick electrodes are bound with mass transport issues that limit their performance at high current densities, especially in H2/air PEMFCs. Practical Fe-N-C electrodes must combine high intrinsic ORR activity, high site density, and fast mass transport.

A cathode comprising this Fe-N-C catalyst has exhibited a maximum power density of 0.53 W cm−2 in H2/air PEMFC at 80 °C.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Conspectus Heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction is a promising process for refractory wastewater treatment. Among the various heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts, Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show great potential for hydrogen peroxide and persulfate activation owing to their low toxicity, simple preparation, and high activity. To further improve the catalytic activity of PBAs and their derivatives (PBDs), many efforts have been made to overcome the instability of the crystal structure and develop feasible methodologies to prepare PBAs/PBDs with diverse morphologies and compositions. In this Account, our recent achievements on novel synthetic strategies to obtain PBAs/PBDs with controlled morphologies, geometric sites, and electronic structures were systematically summarized. The physicochemical properties of the PBAs/PBDs and their contribution to the catalytic reaction in the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were also discussed. First, we focus on developing a novel synthesis technology (such as “copolymer-co-morphology” conception) of PBAs with controllable morphology. By regulating the chelating agents, surfactants, metal ions, and preparation conditions and constructing a heterojunction, the stability of PBAs/PBDs was significantly improved to overcome their instability during redox reaction. Notably, to inherit the characteristics of PBAs, a topological transformation strategy was applied to fabricate metal oxides with morphologies similar to those of PBAs through thermal calcination under an aerobic atmosphere. Subsequently, this strategy has been extensively applied to prepare single-atom catalysts, metal nitrides, and zerovalent metals via thermal treatment under inert/reducing atmospheres. These novel strategies provide guidance for devising controllable PBAs/PBDs materials with superior activity and stability during cycling tests not only in Fenton-like reactions but also in other catalytic systems. In addition to the physicochemical property optimization, the relationship between the deliberately designed electronic structure and the catalytic activity of PBAs/PBDs was first explored in depth using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. Moreover, benefiting from these efficient techniques and conscientious explorations, our research not only elucidated the important descriptors for the intrinsic oxidation pathways but also revealed the significant effect of external energy (ultraviolet and visible light) on the catalytic pathways in PBAs/PBDs-dominant Fenton-like systems. These findings provide a novel inspiration for further application of additional energy. Finally, the recent challenges and development prospects of PBAs/PBDs in AOPs are comprehensively discussed. Overall, this Account provides comprehensive insights into PBAs/PBDs fabrication strategies, physicochemical properties, local electronic structures, and the intrinsic correlation between these characteristics and catalytic mechanisms using advanced analysis techniques and paves the way for the future development of PBAs/PBDs in various catalysis fields.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'In this study, systematic first-principles calculations were carried out to ascertain the optimal single-atom catalyst (SAC) among the 3d-transition metals (TM1 = Fe1, Co1, Ni1, Cu1, and Zn1) anchored on a phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) cluster for efficient benzene oxidation to phenol, which is otherwise challenging at ambient temperature. Strong binding due to substantial charge transfer between Fe1 and PMA, and the adsorption energies of H2O2 and O2 oxidants enabled significant bonding within the Fe1/PMA cluster, facilitating enhanced catalytic performance compared to that of 3d-TM1 (Co1, Ni1, Cu1, and Zn1). The Fe1/PMA cluster demonstrated enhanced reactivity towards H2O2 supported by lower activation barriers and rate-determining steps for H2O2 (0.84 and 0.67 eV) compared to O2 (1.02 and 0.66 eV). The spontaneous dissociation of H2O2 on Fe1/PMA, in contrast to O2, is a crucial step to initiate iron-oxo (Fe1-O) active site formation, easing benzene to phenol oxidation at ambient temperature. Thus, the proficient coordination environment of Fe1 atoms as SACs adsorbed on the PMA cluster is found to influence catalytic performance, especially in the case of H2O2. The proposed mechanism is reminiscent of hydrocarbon hydroxylation in enzymatic processes, establishing Fe1/PMA as an environmentally friendly, heterogeneous and non-noble metal green catalyst for electrocatalytic phenol production.',\n",

However, its application in the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) field still suffers from unsatisfactory performance, due to the sluggish mass transfer and significant kinetic barriers. Herein, a novel rare-earth-lanthanum-evoked optimization strategy is proposed to boost ambient NRR over SACs. The incorporation of La with a large atomic radius tends to break the atomic long-range order and trigger the amorphization of SACs, endowing a greater density of dangling bonds that could modify affinity for reactants and adsorbates. Moreover, with unique 5d16s2 valence-electron configurations, its presence could further enrich the electron density and enhance the intrinsic activity of single-metal center via the valence orbital coupling. As expected, the La-modified catalyst presents excellent activity toward the electrochemical NRR, delivering a maximum ammonia yield rate of 33.91 μg h-1 mg-1 and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 53.82%.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Coordination engineering was employed to optimize the coordination environment of the zirconium (Zr) atom anchored on the porphyrins (PP), serving as single-atom catalysts (SACs). Five promising ZrPP-A (A = C3O, N4, N2C2-o, C2O2-o, and C2O2-n) candidates as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) were identified through a “four-step” screening strategy, from a pool of 15 designed models. Performance evaluation of these candidates for NRR was conducted using first-principles calculations. A comprehensive examination of reaction pathways unveiled a predilection for a hybrid pathway when employing the selected catalysts for the NRR. The stability and notable catalytic activity of ZrPP-A stemmed from orbital hybridization and charge transfer mechanisms, occurring both between Zr and its coordinated atoms, as well as between ZrPP-A and the adsorbed N2 molecule. Zr played a pivotal role in orchestrating charge transfer during the NRR process. Simultaneously, coordinating atoms and the PP moiety collectively facilitated supplementary charge transfers to or from the adsorbate. Because of the robust coupling between O and its neighboring carbon atoms, no significant bonds were detected between the central Zr and the coordinating O atoms. An asymmetric coordination environment results in an uneven charge distribution within the substrate, inducing polarization of N2 molecules and their migration toward regions of asymmetric charge aggregation. This study underscores the significance of not only focusing on the single-atom catalyst itself but also its coordination environment when designing catalysts for enhanced efficiency.',\n",

This is particularly the case in Fe-based Fenton-like reaction, in which both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are active but react with significantly different catalytic rates. While the elemental metal loading can be easily assessed by elemental analysis, the determination of the oxidation degree is more challenging. To do so, we designed single Fe-based meso-macroporous silica materials as catalysts for the degradation of methylene blue, an organic dye serving as a well-known model for the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater. The silica materials were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel process through a combined templating mechanism with micelles and solid lipid nanoparticles of Fe-based surfactants.

In this study, we investigated various reaction pathways and barrier energies for the N2O reduction process onto Si-coordinated phthalocyanine (Si@PthC) employing density functional theory. The outcomes validate that Si decoration in PthC is energetically stable while the corresponding electronic properties show that the Si atom acts as the reactive site for catalytic activity. The N2O molecule exhibits spontaneous dissociation over the catalyst surface from the O-end with −4.01 eV dissociation energy. Meanwhile, N2O dissociation via the N-end involves chemisorption onto the Si@PthC surface with an adsorption energy (Ead) of −1.16 eV, and the dissociation needs an energy barrier of 0.51 eV. The bond distances and negative adsorption energies (−1.11 and −2.40 eV) evince that CO and O2 species chemisorbed onto the Si@PthC surface. However, these energies are smaller than the N2O dissociation energy, which demonstrates that the presence of CO and O2 molecules cannot interrupt the N2O reduction process. Additionally, the CO + O* → CO2 reaction was executed for catalyst recovery, and the reaction proceeds very quickly on the Si@PthC catalyst, with a very small energy barrier (0.37 eV), indicating the excellent catalytic reactivity of the studied catalyst.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'It has been reported that it was selective to produce ammonia on metallic cobalt in the electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (eNORR), where hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt outperforms face-centered cubic (fcc) cobalt. However, hydroxylamine is more selectively produced on a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC). Herein, we uncover the structural sensitivity over hcp-Co, fcc-Co, and Co-SAC in eNORR by employing a recently developed constant potential simulation method and microkinetic modeling. It was found that the superior activity for ammonia production on hcp-Co can be attributed to its facile electron and proton transfer and a stronger lateral suppression effect from NO* over fcc-Co. The exceptional hydroxylamine selectivity on Co-SAC is due to the modified electronic structure, namely, a positively charged active center. It was found that it is more favorable to produce NOH* over hcp-Co and fcc-Co, while HNO* is more preferable on Co-SAC, which are firmly correlated with the vertical and strong NO adsorption on the former and the moderate adsorption on the latter. In other words, a key factor for selectivity control is the first step of NO* protonation. Therefore, the local structure and electronic structure of the catalysts can be critical in regulating the activity and selectivity in eNORR.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Herein, Mn, Fe, and Ni single atoms are designed to be embedded into the six-membered cavity of the adjacent graphite phase carbon nitride layer, and the 2p orbitals of interlayer N atoms are hybridized with 3d orbitals of the Mn, Fe, and Ni single atom to form Mn–N–Fe–N–Ni charge transfer bridge throughout the six-membered cavity of the graphite phase carbon nitride. The DFT calculations provide a clear explanation for how the p–d orbital hybridization of Mn–N–Fe–N–Ni atoms facilitate the creation of a charge-transfer pathway. This pathway, which is located in the Mn–N–Fe–N–Ni charge-transfer bridge, serve as the catalyst for the degradation of oxytetracycline hydrochloride through photocatalysis. The photoatalytic activity is much higher than the graphite phase carbon nitride. The effects of the Mn–N–Fe–N–Ni charge transfer bridge on the migration of photogenerated carriers, photocatalytic degradation performance, and degradation mechanism are discussed in detail. In order to improve the degradation efficiency of oxytetracycline hydrochloride, the Mn–N–Fe–N–Ni charge-transfer bridge is utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under visible light exposure. The factors affecting the activation of PMS for oxytetracycline hydrochloride degradation are thoroughly investigated, and the degradation mechanism is also analyzed.

In this work, we successfully synthesized an Fe-N5 SAC with axial N coordination, which exhibited exceptional catalytic performance by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for degrading 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in a wide pH range (4.0-10.0). The rate constant of Fe-N5 (2.99 min−1) was 6.36 times higher than that of Fe-N4, and the turnover frequency (TOF) of Fe-N5 was found to be 4-149 times higher than those of state-of-the-art SACs and nanocatalysts reported in the literature for 4-CP degradation by PMS activation. Moreover, Fe-N5 was not significantly affected by coexisting substances (HA, HCO3−, SO42−, H2PO4−, NO3−, and Cl−) and had satisfactory degradation efficiency for various chlorophenols. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), quenching experiments, and radical probe experiments demonstrated that1O2 played a key role in the Fe-N5/PMS system for 4-CP degradation. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that a narrower gap between the Fe-3d band center and Fermi level enhanced the electron transfer in Fe-N5, which resulted in promoted PMS activation. In addition, the Fe-N5/PMS system showed good potential for application in real wastewater. The above findings offer important implications for the future of coordination chemistry in designing M-Nx-C SACs (x > 4), highlighting their practical applications in environmental remediation.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'An FeN4 single-atom catalyst (SAC) embedded in a graphene matrix is considered an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for its good activity and durability, and decoration on the Fe active site can further modulate the performance of the FeN4 SAC. In this work, the axial heteroatom (L = P, S and Cl)-decorated FeN4 SAC (FeN4L) and pure FeN4 were comparatively studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that the rate-determining step (RDS) in the ORR on pure FeN4 is the reduction of OH to H2O in the last step with an overpotential of 0.58 V. However, the RDS of the ORR for the axial heteroatom-decorated FeN4L is the reduction of O2 to OOH in the first step. The axial P and S heteroatom-decorated FeN4P and FeN4S exhibit lower activity than pure FeN4 since the overpotentials of the ORR on FeN4P and FeN4S are 1.02 V and 1.09 V, respectively. Meanwhile, FeN4Cl exhibits the best activity towards the ORR since it possesses the lowest overpotential (0.51 V). The main reason is that the axial heteroatom decoration alleviates the adsorption of all the species in the whole ORR, thus modulating the free energy in every elementary reaction step. A volcano relationship between the d band center and the ORR activity can be determined among the axial heteroatom-decorated FeN4L SACs. The d band center of the Fe atom in various FeN4L SACs follows the order of FeN4 > FeN4Cl > FeN4S > FeN4P, whereas the overpotential of the ORR on various catalysts follows the order of FeN4Cl > FeN4 > FeN4S ≈ FeN4P. ΔG(*OH) is a simple descriptor for the prediction of the ORR activity of various axial heteroatom-decorated FeN4L, although the RDS in the ORR is either the first step or the last step. This paper provides a guide to the design and selection of the ORR over SACs with different axial heteroatom decorations, contributing to the rational design of more powerful ORR electrocatalysts and achieving advances in electrochemical conversion and storage devices.',\n",

Introducing Co into Fe single-atoms and secondary pyrolysis altered Fe coordination with N, creating an asymmetric environment that promoted charge transfer and increased the density of states near the Fermi level.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6-x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.',\n",

Herein, a charge-asymmetry “armor” SAA (named Pd1Fe SAA@PC), which consists of a Pd1Fe alloy core and a semiconducting P-doped C (PC) shell, is rationally designed as an ideal catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes with high efficiency. Multiple spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculations have demonstrated that Pd1Fe SAA@PC is dual-regulated by lattice tensile and Schottky effects, which govern the selectivity and activity of hydrogenation, respectively. (1) The PC shell layer applied an external traction force causing a 1.2% tensile strain inside the Pd1Fe alloy to increase the reaction selectivity. (2) P doping into the C-shell layer realized a transition from a p-type semiconductor to an n-type semiconductor, thereby forming a unique Schottky junction for advancing alkyne semihydrogenation activity. The dual regulation of lattice strain and the Schottky effect ensures the excellent performance of Pd1Fe SAA@PC in the semihydrogenation reaction of phenylethylene, achieving a conversion rate of 99.9% and a selectivity of 98.9% at 4 min.

The total solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is up to 0.372‰, which is among the highest reported values. The success, on one hand, depends on the Co single atoms and Ni clusters for both extended spectrum absorption and serving as dual-active centers for CO2 reduction and H2O dissociation, respectively; on the other hand, this is attributed to the enhanced photoelectric and thermal effect induced by concentrated solar irradiation. We demonstrate that an intermediate impurity state is formed by the hybridization of the d-orbital of single-atom Co with the molecular orbital of H2O, enabling visible-light-driven excitation over the catalyst.

In this study, we present the synthesis of a copper-based single-atom catalyst featuring atomic Cu on nitrogen-doped carbon black (Cu1-NCB). Attributed to the highly dispersed single-atom Cu sites and the effective suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction, Cu1-NCB demonstrated an optimal N2 faradaic efficiency (82.1%) and yield rate (3.53 mmol h-1 mgmetal-1) at −0.2 and −0.5 V vs RHE, respectively, outperforming previously reported N2ORR electrocatalysts.

In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.',\n",

In this paper, a series of Cu SACs with different coordination environments were synthesized to elaborately regulate the peroxymonosulfate activation pathway in AOPs to clarify active species generation and transformation in water remediation. The degradation rate constants (kobs) of Cu-N2, Cu-N3, and Cu-N4 were 0.028, 0.021, and 0.015 min-1, respectively. Cu-N2 SACs exhibited a noticeable enhanced performance for bisphenol A (BPA) removal from water compared to that of the Cu-Nx SACs (x = 3, 4), accompanied by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation pathway variation. As shown by experimental and theoretical results, the PMS activation pathway was transformed from ROS to electron transfer with nitrogen coordination numbers decreasing from 4 to 2, which can be ascribed to the uneven charge distribution of Cu sites as well as upshifts in the d-band center, and thereby optimized electron transfer for PMS activation. Furthermore, the increasing nitrogen vacancies of single Cu site catalysts can also result in more unoccupied 3d orbitals of Cu atoms in SACs, thereby improving the intermediates' (PMS and BPA) adsorption-desorption process and BPA removal performance.

Herein, we develop a ligand-confining thermolysis strategy to fabricate a Ru single-atom catalyst (Ru-SA/NSC) on N,S-codoped carbon. The adsorption mode effects of substrate alcohols on the electrocatalytic oxidation of Ru-SA/NSC are unraveled through modulation of substituent groups. The horizontal adsorption through the O atom on Ru-SA/NSC significantly facilitates the benzyl alcohol oxidation, delivering ultralow potential of 0.97 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm-2 with high yield (∼96%), selectivity (∼99%), and Faraday efficiency (∼100%) to produce aldehydes. The vertical adsorption through the N atom in pyridine methanol over Ru-SA/NSC has no response to the reaction. Furthermore, in the coupling device of alcohol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production with a low potential of 1.21 V at 10 mA cm-2 is achieved, surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C||IrO2 (1.56 V) and the state-of-the-art reports.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Catalysts with noble metals deposited as single atoms on metal oxide supports have recently been studied extensively due to their maximized metal utilization and potential for performing difficult chemical conversions owing to their unique electronic properties. Understanding of the reaction mechanisms on supported single-metal atoms is still limited but is highly important for designing more efficient catalysts. In this study, we report the complexity of the CO oxidation reaction mechanism on Pt single atoms supported on anatase TiO2 (PtSA/a-TiO2) by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis with kinetic measurements, in situ/operando infrared, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. Starting from the adsorbed PtSA occupying an O vacancy induced by reductive pretreatment, we show that CO oxidation follows a complex mechanism consisting of initiation steps to reorganize the active site and multibranch reactive cycles, with the PtSA/a-TiO2 catalyst not returning to its initial configuration. The initiation step consists of CO and O2 adsorption healing the O vacancy, followed by CO oxidation using gas-phase CO to form Pt(CO). The reactive cycle alternates O2 adsorption and dissociation to oxidize the catalyst to Pt(O)(O)(CO) and branching pathways of competing Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH)- or Eley-Rideal (ER)-type CO oxidation steps to reduce it again to Pt(CO). In situ/operando infrared experiments, including cryogenic CO adsorption and isotopic CO exchange, confirm the combined involvement of strongly adsorbed CO and gas-phase CO in an Eley-Rideal step along the reaction cycle. Microkinetic modeling shows that Pt single atoms are present in a mixture of Pt(CO), Pt(CO)(O2), Pt(O)(CO)(O2), and Pt(CO)(CO3) structures as the main intermediates during steady-state CO oxidation, all having the C-O vibrational stretch close to the experimentally observed value of 2115 cm-1. Microkinetic modeling also shows that the fractional orders of CO and O2 measured experimentally originate from multiple steps with a high degree of rate control and not from a simple competitive adsorption. The results demonstrate the complex reaction pathways that even CO oxidation on a simple single-atom system can follow, providing mechanistic insights for designing efficient Pt-based single-atom catalysts. We further show that microkinetic modeling results are sensitive to changes in energies of intermediate and transition states within errors of density functional theory, which can ultimately lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the reaction pathways and most abundant reaction intermediates if not accounted for by experiments.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The high conductivity and low decomposition potential of LiOH as the discharge product in Li-O2 batteries have garnered significant attention. However, challenges remain in developing LiOH-based Li-O2 batteries and promoting efficient generation/decomposition of LiOH. Here, we propose a strategy to build a binder-free cathode for Li-O2 batteries by embedding atomically dispersed Ru onto the surface of MnCo2O4 (RuSA-MnCo2O4) through defect engineering and adsorption-deposition methods, harnessing the synergistic benefits of spinel and a single atom in terms of catalytic activity and physical structure. The embedding of Ru leads to slight lattice distortion of MnCo2O4 and electron enrichment near Co, breaking the long-range ordered and symmetrical structure of spinel and transforming the symmetrical Mn/Co low-activity centers into asymmetrical Ru-O-Co high-activity centers. Compared to that of MnCo2O4, the d-band center of RuSA-MnCo2O4 is positioned further away from the Fermi level, resulting in an increased occupancy of antibonding orbitals. This leads to more moderate adsorption energies for LiO2* and LiOH*, as well as a reduction in the reaction barrier for LiOH formation, thereby optimizing the kinetics of the redox reactions. Thanks to the catalytic active center regulated by RuSA, the electrochemical performances were greatly improved, which also provides a clever approach for the development of catalysts for LiOH-based Li-O2 batteries.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The complicated dynamics of active sites on single-atom catalysts under reducing conditions limits their applications in hydrogenation reactions and mechanistic understanding. Herein, we report that on Rh1/TiO2, *H spillover during room-temperature ethylene hydrogenation hydroxylates and reduces TiO2, enhancing the intrinsic activity of Rh1 by 9-fold. Spectroscopic and kinetic evidence suggests that the spillover of *H is suppressed by their facile reaction with C2H4, most of the spilled *H are nonreactive spectators, and >99% turnovers occur on a small subset (<20%) of exposed “active Rh1”. Steady-state kinetics indicates competitive adsorption between H and C2H4, H2 dissociation is the rate-determining step, and the apparent activation barrier (Ea,app) of the reaction is ∼48 kJ/mol. The evolution of Rh1 under H2 was further tracked by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques at elevated temperatures. At 200 °C, more Rh1 are exposed, but these Rh1 are at least 5-fold less active than that of the “active Rh1”. At 300 °C, Rh clusters derived from Rh1 become the main active sites, shifting Ea,app to 62 kJ/mol, characteristic of Rh nanoparticles. At ≥400 °C, larger and more active Rh particles in the strong metal-support interaction state are created. This work revealed the unexpected regulation effects of *H spillover on M1 active sites under ambient conditions, differentiated the minority active M1 sites, and demonstrated how the stability of M1 under reducing atmospheres affects hydrogenation catalysis.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in advancing heterogeneous single-atom catalysts (SACs), propelled by their extraordinary properties such as unique activities, high selectivity, and efficient metal utilization. In contrast to their nanoparticle counterparts, SACs showcase distinct advantages, yet they are not exempt from limitations. A primary constraint lies in their relatively low metal content and lack of ensemble sites, potentially impacting overall catalytic activity. Stability concerns also arise, as isolated metal atoms may be prone to aggregation, oxidation, and other structural changes. To surmount these challenges, there is a burgeoning exploration of synergies between SACs and other active species, such as single atoms, atomic clusters, or nanoparticles. This approach holds promise for augmenting the efficiency of complex catalytic reactions. However, a systematic examination of their integration and potential synergy has been notably absent. This review strives to fill that gap by comprehensively exploring key interactions, complementary effects, and bifunctional roles of single atoms, atomic clusters and nanoparticles when combined in different compositions and configurations, especially for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) applications. Additionally, the review sheds new light on the underlying catalytic mechanisms by offering insights through specific case studies. In particular, it emphasizes the dynamic nature of each active species and their interactions within these innovative catalytic entities, specifically in the context of heterogeneous electrocatalytic processes, backed by compelling in situ and operando evidence. Concluding the discussion, the review addresses the current challenges and provides a glimpse into the prospects of these integrated catalytic systems in the future. The contents can serve as a valuable guide for the design of advanced catalysts, promoting the deliberate combination and synergy of binary or multiple active species to further advance the field of catalysis with a clear roadmap and easy assessments.',\n",

However, the design principle of the asymmetric coordination that can efficiently promote bidirectional conversion of polysulfides has not been fully realized. Herein, a series of Co─N3X1 (X refers to F, O, Cl, S, or P) configurations are established, and theoretically unravel that the relative electronegativity value (REV) can be used as an index parameter for characterizing the catalytic activity. By virtue of enhanced chemical affinity with sulfur species and lowered Li2S decomposition, chlorine-atom-constructed asymmetric configurations with an optimal REV exhibit stronger catalytic effect to inhibit shuttling. Such a REV-related catalytic effect is termed as REV effect. Following this principle, a novel single-atom catalyst with dominated Co─N3Cl1 configuration is successfully synthesized through an inside-out thermal reaction strategy and used as a modified layer on the cathode-side separator. Interestingly, the assembled Li─S batteries exhibit quite high rate capacity (804.3 mAh g−1 at 5.0 C), durable cyclability (0.023% capacity decay per cycle), and competitive areal capacity (7.0 mAh cm−2 under 7.5 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and lean electrolyte).

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Isolated metal-coordinated nitrogen embedded carbon (M-N-C) materials are potential alternatives to noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the activity of metal centers can be further modulated by adjusting the coordination environment. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the aggregation of metal atoms into small clusters or particles is inevitable during the high temperature pyrolysis, while the influences of metal clusters on the OER activity of single metal atoms in M-N-C are unclear. Herein, taking Ni-based single atom as examples, the interaction characters of NiN4 doped graphene (NiN4-graphene) with different Ni clusters were studied. The modulation effects of Ni clusters to the NiN4-graphene were systematically investigated from the geometric configurations, electronic structures, and the OER activity of the Ni single atom. It was found that the OER performance of NiN4-graphene can be remarkably improved through the addition of Ni clusters, and the lowest overpotential of 0.43 V is achieved on NiN4-graphene with the modification of Ni13 cluster, which is smaller than that of 0.69 V on NiN4-graphene. Electronic properties calculations showed that the charge transfer from Ni clusters to NiN4-graphene will alter the density of states of Ni single atom near the Fermi level, which promotes the charge transfer from NiN4-graphene to oxygen containing products and optimizes the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediate to close to the ideal adsorption free energy of 2.46 eV by enhancing the hybridization interaction between the O-p orbitals and the Ni-dxz , Ni-dyz orbitals, and finally leading to an enhanced OER activity. The current findings highlight the important role of metal clusters on improving the catalytic performance of M-N-C materials, which benefits for the rational design of M-N-C catalysts with high catalytic activity.',\n",

How to achieve the optimal antibacterial activity and regenerative repair of infective bone defect simultaneously is a huge challenge in clinic. Herein, this work reports a rational integration of Mn single-atom nanozyme into the 3D-printed bioceramic scaffolds (Mn/HSAE@BCP scaffolds). The integrated Mn/HSAE@BCP scaffolds can catalyze the conversion of H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radical (•OH) and superoxide anion (O2•−) through cascade reaction. Besides, the prominent thermal conversion efficiency of Mn/HSAE@BCP scaffolds can be utilized for sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The synergetic strategy of chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/SDT enables the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) or Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, the enhanced antibacterial efficacy of Mn/HSAE@BCP scaffolds is beneficial to upregulate the expression of osteogenesis-related markers (such as collagen 1(COL1), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteoprotegerin (OPG)) in vitro and further promote bone regeneration in vivo.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The active site isolation strategy has long been used to perform selective hydrogenation of acetylene. Out of all of the approaches available for isolating active sites, the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides an attractive route to enhancing selectivity. Herein, SACs in the form of metal alkoxides (where the metal varies from Sc to Zn) have been immobilized onto the organic linkers of the UiO-67 metal-organic framework (MOF), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to thoroughly examine their hydrogenation ability. Given that there are four pathways detrimental to C2H4 selectivity, namely, (a) C2H4 hydrogenation pathway, (b) C2H2 overhydrogenation pathway, (c) CHCH3 hydrogenation pathway, and (d) C2 oligomerization to 1,3-butadiene, UiO-67(Co) has been screened out to be the most efficient catalyst. Comparison with other studies shows that the hydrogenation ability of the UiO-67(Co) MOF is superior to that of many Pd-based catalysts and some non-Pd-based catalysts. Although isolation of active sites has been shown to effectively inhibit the production of green oils, our findings are contrary to the previously reported phenomena. Our study shows that the use of SACs does not guarantee inhibition of green oil formation─two C2 molecules can adsorb at the same active site and can undergo C-C coupling. Selectivity of the reaction is hampered when C2 oligomerization to 1,3-butadiene becomes more competent than the C2H4 desorption pathway. In the realm of SACs, the choice of modulating the ethylene adsorption mode/energy is not available, and hence, we have reported a new strategy to enhance C2H4 selectivity. Since the availability of H atoms is crucial for the hydrogenation process, the key to attaining selectivity is to reduce the availability of H atoms to an extent that ethylene hydrogenation can be prevented without hampering acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene. This criterion is accurately met by UiO-67(Co).',\n",

Different dipole-induced responses of intermediates to electric fields break the original scaling relationships and effectively tune not only the activity but also the product selectivity of the NRR.

Developing an appropriate descriptor to facilitate the design of copper-based catalysts for the efficient synthesis of MG faces significant challenges. Herein, we used single-atom Cu supported by different materials as catalyst models to investigate the relationship between the electronic structure of active sites and MG selectivity by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Calculated results indicated that carriers can effectively modulate the electronic structure of Cu and affect the adsorption and further hydrogenation of MG to ethylene glycol (EG) through metal-support interactions. The dissociative pathway and the direct hydrogenation pathway were investigated to gain insights into the key role of two reaction mechanisms in the semihydrogenation of DMO. It is demonstrated that the energy difference between the activation barrier of further hydrogenation of MG to EG and the desorption energy for MG based on the direct hydrogenation pathway can serve as a rapid catalyst screening benchmark and provides the description for product distribution in the DMO hydrogenation. Furthermore, we successfully correlated the Bader charge of the Cu atom with the strength of the copper-support interaction and observed that as the Cu-support interaction weakened, the selectivity of MG increased.

However, the difficult ethanol dehydrogenation and insufficient active sites for proton reduction within the catalysts, and the long spatial distance between these two sites always restrict their catalytic activity. Here, guided by the strong metal-substrate interaction effect, an atomic-level catalyst design strategy to construct Pt-S3 single atom on ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (PtSA-ZIS) is demonstrated. As active center with optimized H adsorption energy to facilitate H2 evolution reaction, the unique Pt single atom also donates electrons to its neighboring S atoms with electron-enriched sites formed to activate the O─H bond in *CH3CHOH and promote the desorption of *CH3CHO. Thus, the synergy between Pt single atom and ZIS together will reduce the energy barrier for the ethanol oxidization to acetaldehyde, and also narrow the spatial distance for proton mass transfer. These features enable PtSA-ZIS photocatalyst to produce acetaldehyde with a selectivity of ≈100%, which will spontaneously transform into 1,1-diethoxyethane via acetalization to avoid volatilization.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Single atom catalysts (SACs) dispersed in metal oxide supports offer not only maximized catalyst utilization but also extended modulation capabilities through interactions between the SA and its support. However, achieving facile preparation and ensuring electrochemical durability of such SACs, particularly for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) applications, remain formidable challenges. Our study addresses these issues by employing an amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition in MoO3 to synthesize a cobalt (Co) SA catalyst. This method facilitates the production of highly selective SA catalysts at low temperatures and ensures their enhanced stability in HER applications. The Co SA MoO3 catalyst exhibits superior performance in HER, operating effectively in both acidic and alkaline environments. Significantly, it maintains stable HER activity across these diverse electrolytic conditions. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the exceptional HER performance of Co SA MoO3. These calculations reveal that the strong affinity for hydrogen and water, facilitated by the modulation of the p-band orbitals at specific oxygen sites adjacent to the Co SA, establishes a thermoneutral pathway for HER. This study represents a pivotal advancement, showcasing a highly practical and robust single-atom catalyst, marking a significant stride towards sustainable energy solutions.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Fe(II) regeneration is decisive for highly efficient H2O2-based Fenton-like processes, but the role of cobalt-containing reactive sites in promoting Fe(II) regeneration was overlooked. Herein, a single atom Co-N-C catalyst was employed in Fe(II)/H2O2 system to promote the degradation of diverse organic contaminants. The EPR and quenching experiments indicated Co-N-C significantly enhanced the generation of superoxide species, and accelerated hydroxyl radical generation for pollutant degradation. The electrochemical and surface composition analyses demonstrated the enhanced H2O2 activation and Fe(III)/Fe(II) recycling on the catalyst. Furthermore, in-situ Raman characterization with shell-isolated gold nanoparticles was employed to visualize the interfacial reactive intermediates and their time-resolved interaction. The accumulation of interfacial CoOOH* was confirmed when Co-N-C activated H2O2 alone, but it rapidly transformed into FeOOH* upon Fe(II) addition. Besides, the temporal variation of OOH* intermediates and the relative intensity of Co(III)-O and Co(IV)=O peaks depicted the dynamic interaction of reactive intermediates along the H2O2 consumption. With this basis, we proposed a mechanism of interfacial OOH* mediated Fe(II) regeneration, which overcame the kinetical limitation of Fe(II)/H2O2 system. Therefore, this study provided a primary effort to elucidate the overlooked role of interfacial CoOOH* in the Fenton-like processes, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'In most cases, the sintering tendency of supported metal single atoms could be attributed to the unstable structural characteristics of supports in demanding operating conditions, particularly for high-loading single-atom catalysts (SACs), ultimately resulting in deactivation. To address this issue, SiO2 is employed to enhance the structural stability of both supports and the supported Pd single atoms. SiO2 serves not only to prevent the collapse of support structures but also to promote the activation of surface oxygen species by facilitating electron transfer with the supports. This, in turn, establishes strong metal-support interactions (MSIs) to stabilize and activate atomically dispersed Pd species. Additionally, the electrons donated from Ce-O and Si-O to Pd atoms further catalyze the formation of oxygen vacancies, ultimately leading to significantly improved activity and durability in CO oxidation. Without SiO2, the instability of support structure, coupled with the weak MSIs, promotes the aggregation of Pd atoms, resulting in relatively lower catalytic activity and durability.',\n",

Pt was deposited on CeO2 in different forms of Pt single atoms (0.15Pt1/CeO2) and Pt nanoparticles (0.56Pt/CeO2), respectively. CO conversion (400 °C) and turnover frequency (TOF) (250 °C) of the Pt single atom catalyst 0.15Pt1/CeO2 were 89% and 0.85 s−1, respectively, significantly higher than that of the Pt nanoparticle catalyst 0.56Pt/CeO2 for the WGS reaction. The superior catalytic performance Pt single atom catalyst can be attributed to enhanced low-temperature reducibility and increased oxygen vacancies facilitated. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in-DRIFTS) revealed that Pt single atoms promoted the creation of oxygen vacancies on CeO2, which dissociated H2O to H2 and adsorbed O, that subsequently interacted with the weakly adsorbed CO on these Pt sites to generate CO2. In contrast, the adsorption strength of CO nanoparticles Pt was much higher. CO reacted with the OH groups on the Pt nanoparticle catalyst surface to form formate species, which then decomposed to produce both CO2 and H2.

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Direct coupling of CO2 and ethylene (hereinafter DCCE) to acrylic acid is valuable for valorizing CO2 to manufacture acrylate-derived products. However, previous studies in DCCE have been limited on molecular catalysts with challenges in improving catalytic performance. In this work, we employed density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heterogeneous catalysis of DCCE over atomically dispersed metal centers at nitrogen-doped zigzag edge of graphene. Based on competitive adsorption and structural stability, Mo, Cr, V, Ru, and Ni active sites are chosen to explore the reaction kinetics. We find that the activation barriers are determined by the charge redistribution at transition states, which explains the trend of activity for the C-C coupling and the hydrogen transfer, two key steps in DCCE. Furthermore, we show that the intramolecular hydrogen transfer (rate-limiting step) is hindered due to the lack of local coordinate at the active sites. We thus propose to use co-adsorbed water as a “proton-exchanger” following a water-assisted route, and show that the activation barriers are reduced over all metal centers. Particularly, water promotes the hydrogen transfer over metals with strong CO2-ethylene co-activation and facile C-C coupling kinetics, which could be considered promising for DCCE. In both mechanisms, the stability of metallactone intermediate can be used to predict the catalytic activity. It is anticipated that the insights from this work can provide guidelines for mimicking well-defined multifunctional active sites in molecular catalysts to design heterogeneous catalysts for such C-C coupling, which advances catalytic utilization of CO2.',\n",

Dual atom catalysts (DACs) can provide dispersed active sites and distinct electronic structure, which is conducive to the catalytic performance. In this work, we explored a series of DACs composed of transition metals or main group metals supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (M2–NC) toward high-performance CO2RR. The radius of metal atom is a key factor determining the stability of M2–NC, that metals (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Sn, Pt, and Bi) with small radius can be steadily anchored. Fe2/Co2/Ru2–NC are screened out to activate CO2 because of the strong interaction between metals d orbitals and CO2 2π orbitals. The results show that Fe2/Co2–NC can promote CO2RR to generate HCOOH with limiting potentials (UL) of −0.36 and −0.25 V. Ru2–NC can catalyze the generation of CH3OH and CH4 with UL of −0.28 V.

Here, the catalytic performance of Mo atom anchored on graphene surfaces regulated by non-metal (X = B, P, S, N) for water splitting and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is investigated by the first principles of density functional theory (DFT). The structural and electronical properties calculation demonstrated that the stable Mo@X4C systems can be created where covalent bond is formed between Mo and X atoms. It is also found that the adsorption ability of H2O on Mo@X4C (X = B, P, S, N) surfaces are directly related to d-band centers of Mo atoms. In water splitting process, the splitting reaction energy barrier of H2O has the trend of Mo@B4C < Mo@P4C < Mo@S4C < Mo@N4C. Significant orbital hybridization coupling and charge transfer occur between adsorbed H2O molecule and Mo@X4C surfaces. Specifically, the Mo@B4C catalyst is predicted to exhibit not only promising splitting activity, but also superior high performance for HER. And the value of ΔGH* is 0.04 eV, which is very close to ideal zero. Thus, it can be recommended as a stable, low-cost and superior performance catalyst for hydrogen production. Lower Bader charge of Mo and larger work function both facilitate the release of hydrogen.

The results of control experimental studies confirm the synergistic interaction of uncoordinated N-doped sites boost the CO2RR activity of Ni–N4 sites. Additionally, density functional theory calculations show that the strong interaction between the Ni-NPs and Ni–N–C did not affect the electronic structures of the Ni–N4 centers, but rather alter the electronic structure of uncoordinated pyridinic-N sites.

This study confirms the importance of hydroxyl groups on vacancy–deficient reducible oxides as active groups. On the one hand, spontaneous atomic dispersion of active metal Ir is promoted by the abundant terminal hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, Ir cations anchor on the TiO2 surface through exchange with H+ in Ti–OH groups, and thus occupy the Brönsted acid sites. The adsorption strength of NH3 is another key factor affecting the reaction rate–determining step, namely NH3 dehydrogenation, which occurs at a faster rate in the coordinated L–NH3 rather than the ionic B–NH4+. Meanwhile, the coordinated L–NH3 significantly avoids the competitive adsorption of water vapor in the NH3–SCO reaction by reducing the number of hydrogen bonding.

However, the UOR suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics due to its six-electron, proton-coupled nature, underscoring the need for the development of highly efficient catalysts. In this work, we have meticulously probed the urea oxidation activities over Ni single-atom doped Cu2O (Ni-Cu2O) and elucidated their underlying mechanisms. The Ni single atom substituted a copper atom on the surface/subsurface of Cu2O:{110}Cu and Cu2O:{111}O. The theoretical calculation results demonstrated that the Ni-Cu2O:{110}Cu configuration exhibits optimal urea adsorption energy, which is conducive to effectively activating the urea molecule and lowering the energy barriers of the subsequent dehydrogenation and nitrogen-nitrogen coupling. The enhanced catalytic performance is primarily due to the synergistic interplay between the surface copper atoms and the single nickel atom within the Ni-Cu2O:{110}Cu structure. This synergy facilitates the activation of nitrogen in urea by the nickel atom, while the copper atoms robustly adsorb oxygen from urea, collectively modulating the π-electron distribution within the urea molecule to activate N-H and C-N bonds. Remarkably, the overpotential for urea oxidation on this catalyst is only 0.29 V, establishing it as an exemplary candidate for urea electrooxidation.

The calculation results indicate that the spin population can be changed by reactant adsorption in the catalytic processes. Through rational manipulation of the TM type and spin, the activity of TM-SAC can be significantly improved. To shed light on the enhancement mechanism and explore some universal descriptors for TM-SACs, a series of structure-property relationships were systemically surveyed. It was found that the interactions between TM and O are very crucial for the binding stability/reactivity of the oxygen-containing reactants. Accordingly, the parameters that can reflect TM and O interactions, including TM-O bond length, key-species (O2), spin moment, and charge transfer (charge on reactant), are all good descriptors for the catalytic performances of different models. More intriguingly, novel spectral descriptors, such as the stretching vibrational frequency of TM-O/O-O/O-H, were also found to have a good linear relationship with the reactivity.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'The electrochemical chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a critical anode reaction in chlor-alkali electrolysis. Although precious metal-based mixed metal oxides (MMOs) have long been used as CER catalysts, they suffer from high cost and poor selectivity due to the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Single-atom catalysts (SACs), featuring high atom utilization efficiency, have captured widespread interest in diverse applications. However, the single-atom sites in SACs are generally recognized as independent motifs and the interplay of adjacent sites is largely overlooked. Herein, we report a “precursor-preselected” cage-encapsulated strategy to synthesize atomically dispersed dinuclear iridium active sites bridged by oxygen that are supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ir2-ONC). The dinuclear Ir2-ONC catalyst exhibits a CER onset potential of 1.375 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, a high faradaic efficiency of >95%, and a high mass activity of 14321.6 A gIr−1, much better than the Ir SACs, which demonstrates the significance of coordination and electronic structure regulation for atomically dispersed catalysts. Density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the unique dinuclear structure facilitates Cl− adsorption, resulting in improved catalytic CER performance.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT': 'Platinum-based catalysts have been largely explored for CO2 valorization by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, especially the Pt/TiO2 system. Understanding the distinct roles of various Pt species and the metal-support interaction, as well as finding ways to tailor them, is crucial for developing and optimizing more active systems. Herein, we employed molecularly defined Pt2+ precursors based on salen ligand for easy Pt speciation according to the activation protocol. Salen-derived ligands are easily accessible coordination compounds that can be designed and combined with various metals, serving as versatile alternatives to create a broad library of metallic precursors. Pyrolysis, oxidizing, or reducing thermal pretreatments were used to decompose the coordination complexes impregnated on TiO2, impacting the Pt species formed, their local environment, electronic properties, and interaction with the support. We showed that at low temperatures (below 300 °C), metallic Pt nanoparticles had the highest activities; however, once exposed to harsher reactional conditions (>400 °C), they deactivated. On the other hand, an oxidative pretreatment induced the growth of mobile platinum clusters that, under a harsher reducing RWGS reactional atmosphere, redispersed into single atoms, being the dominant active site and presenting high activity and stability.',\n",

Interestingly, single metal atom catalysts with a unique electronic structure, low metal content, theoretical 100% atom utilization efficiency, and high catalytic performance can effectively promote the conversion of different lithium polysulfides intermediates and provide abundant absorption sites for sulfur-contained species, thereby optimizing the redox reaction kinetics of the sulfur cathode and shuttle behavior of the soluble lithium polysulfides. Various single metal atom catalysts, mainly including iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, and manganese, have been developed via atomic bonding, spatial confinement, and defect engineering strategies to solve the key challenges of sulfur cathode since single metal atom catalysts were for the first time to be utilized as catalytic agents for LSBs. In this review, the interaction among support materials in single metal atom catalysts, atomically dispersed metal catalytic sites, and the sulfur cathode were addressed in detail, providing a basis for the development of high-performance single metal atom catalysts. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques such as in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammograms, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, were employed to investigate the catalytic effect of single metal atom catalysts. Notably, the effects of the coordination environment on the catalytic activity and selectivity of single metal atom catalysts were systematically discussed. Simultaneously, the catalytic mechanism of single metal atom catalysts with different metal/nonmetallic atoms and coordination configurations was elucidated using theoretical calculations. In addition, some significant challenges of single metal atom catalyst in LSBs were proposed. It is believed that this review will provide a novel insight into the optimization of atomic catalysts with high activity and catalytic selectivity toward long-lifespan LSBs.'),\n",

       "'Sodium–sulfur batteries have attracted attention due to their high energy capacities and low costs, but the dissolution of sodium polysulfides still severely affects their cycle life, limiting their real-world applications. Herein, a stable sulfur host is reported, based on a N,O-codoped carbon composite derived from a bimetallic Cu–Zn metal-organic framework, which ensures high sulfur loading (67 wt%). Most importantly, this composite also includes single-atom copper catalysts, with a high Cu loading of 8.03 wt%. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis show that single atoms of Cu are coordinated with two N and two O atoms within the produced composite material. Those copper sites can weaken S\\uf8ffS bonds in the S8 ring structure, and thus are able to catalyze the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules in even larger-size pores. In addition, Cu atoms facilitate the conversion between the short-chain sulfur and Na2S. As a result, when the produced sulfur-loaded carbon framework containing the atomic Cu catalyst is used as a cathode for sodium–sulfur batteries, it exhibits superior capacity of 776 mAh g–1 with a high sulfur utilization (1158 mAh gs–1 normalized with sulfur content) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–1, and an excellent rate performance of 483 mAh g–1 (720 mAh gs–1) at 5 A g–1.'"
